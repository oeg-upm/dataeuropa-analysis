However, there is also a more complicated reform. In the last 3 seasons, each team had to have at least one youngster on the pitch all the time. Now, there is a more liberal requirement of 3000 minutes. In practice it means that you can start with 2 youngsters in one match and then ignore them in the next one. The reform is unpopular on both sides - most people would prefer to either keep the youngster rule in its previous form or get rid of it completely.\n\n# Preview format\n\nIn a way, this preview will be a convoluted way of making a tier list.

Their greatest successes came in the interwar period and the years shortly after World War II. In 1921, seven Cracovia players started for Poland in the team's first ever international match (0-1 vs Hungary). Since the 1960s, the club played mostly in lower tiers with short exceptions. The situation has finally changed in 2003, when Cracovia advanced to Ekstraklasa and remained there till this day (with one year break in 2012/13). In the last few years the team played 3 times in European qualifiers, but their adventures were disastrous as each time they were eliminated by first opponent they met - FK Shk\u00ebndija, DAC Dunajsk\u00e1 Streda and Malm\u00f6.\n\n**LAST SEASON**\n\n|Position|Points|W|D|L|GF|GA|GD|Biggest win|Biggest defeat|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|9|46|12|10|12|40|42|\\-2|3-0 vs P\u0142ock|0-3 (3 times)|\n\nCoach Micha\u0142 Probierz left Cracovia after 4 years in November 2021. Despite winning the cup in 2020, his tenure can be judged as a failure. Probierz had an unprecedented power. Aside from coaching, he was also a vice-chairman of the club and was personally responsible for the transfers. Unfortunately, Cracovia was becoming more and more unwatchable with every year. Moreover, the club became infamous for signing huge amounts of mediocre foreign players. The experiment failed and Probierz was replaced by Jacek Zieli\u0144ski, who... coached Cracovia directly before him. The impact was visible fastly - the team became more offensive minded while younger Polish players got their chances. In the last few weeks of the season Cracovia managed to draw 1-1 with Rak\u00f3w away, which strongly influenced the title race and helped Lech win the league.\n\n**THIS SEASON**\n\nThe goals of Cracovia aren't overly ambitious - they just want to finish higher than last time and make people forget about Probierz era. The most important player they lost is Dutch midfielder Pelle van Amersfoort, who used to be their crucial player in the last 3 years. However, they look significantly stronger on the position that used to be their weakness - attack. Cracovia signed two promising strikers: I Liga top scorer Patryk Makuch (Mied\u017a) and Finnish international Benjamin K\u00e4llman (Inter Turku). If at least one of them turns out to be prolific, the team has to be stronger than last year. On a side note - as crazy as it sounds, it will be the first season in history when Cracovia is in Ekstraklasa but their local rivals, Wis\u0142a, aren't. Usually it was the other way around.\n\n**POSSIBLE LINEUP**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/262q5j73sib91.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a14c1c9ea22cf0f0b94815c57075df2623931131\n\n**INTERESTING PLAYERS**\n\n**Sergiu Hanca** \\- aside from playing football, Romanian international and Cracovia captain is known for two other things: charity work and [his excited wife](https://twitter.com/WeszloCom/status/1203721790700367877).\n\n**Yevhen Konoplyanka** \\- arguably the second most famous player in the league. Ukrainian winger was disappointing in the spring and has to get in form fastly as he's not even guaranteed to start.\n\n**Kamil Pestka** \\- one of the best left-backs of the league, recently called up to Poland NT.\n\n**Rivaldinho** \\- he's Rivaldo's son, that's enough to be included in \"Interesting players\". Jokes aside, Rivaldinho is a disappointment and won't get much playing time considering the signings of Makuch and K\u00e4llman.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT**\n\n**Potential positive surprise.** While challenging for Europe doesn't seem likely, Zieli\u0144ski has already proved during his first term that he can build a good looking team in a short time. If Cracovia 2022/23 at least resembles Cracovia 2015/16, it will be already a success.\n\n# [G\u00f3rnik Zabrze](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fr/thumb/a/ae/Logo_Gornik_Zabrze.svg/1200px-Logo_Gornik_Zabrze.svg.png)\n\n**Coach:** [Bartosch Gaul](https://d-art.ppstatic.pl/kadry/k/r/1/ca/3f/62bd657f5bf5b_o_large.jpg)\n\n**Debut:** 1956\n\n**Biggest achievement:** Champions (14 times: 1957, 1959, 1961, 1962/63, 1963/64, 1964/65, 1965/66, 1966/67, 1970/71, 1971/72, 1984/85, 1985/86, 1986/87, 1987/88)\n\n**Last season:** 8th\n\n**Nickname:** The Miners\n\n**Stadium:** [Ernest Pohl Stadium (24 563)](https://d-nm.ppstatic.pl/kadr/k/r/e4/34/59956de92edbf_o,size,933x0,q,70,h,4b9c36.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**OVERSIMPLIFIED HISTORY**\n\nG\u00f3rnik was founded shortly after World War II as a club connected with the mining industry. The club dominated Polish football in the 1960s winning 5 consecutive titles, which is a record. At that time, G\u00f3rnik regularly provided stars to Polish NT. In 1970 the team faced Manchester City in the final of UEFA Cup Winners Cup, which they lost 1-2. The second golden era came in the mid/late 1980s, when G\u00f3rnik won 4 consecutive titles. Since then, the club was usually midtable. In 21st century G\u00f3rnik played in the highest tier in nearly all seasons (only 2 years in I Liga). In 2017/18, the club shockingly took 4th place in Ekstraklasa directly after promotion. The results in the following years were more mediocre - G\u00f3rnik finished always between 8th and 11th place.\n\n**LAST SEASON**\n\n|Position|Points|W|D|L|GF|GA|GD|Biggest win|Biggest defeat|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|8|47|13|8|13|55|55|0|3-0 vs Cracovia|1-4 vs Wis\u0142a|\n\nDespite a worrying start, G\u00f3rnik was a quite entertaining side. The team coached by Jan Urban - their legend as a player - was offensive minded and dangerous. The season was marked by the arrival of Lukas Podolski, who fulfilled his promise and joined his boyhood club. Similarly to G\u00f3rnik as a whole, Poldi didn't look well in the first few months, but since the late autumn he became an important figure for the league. In the winter the club from Zabrze lost Spanish forward Jesus Jimenez, who moved to Toronto FC. The transfer caused certain problems as the team didn't have any striker even close to his level. Ultimately G\u00f3rnik finished in the middle as always, but left a better impression than in the previous years.\n\n**THIS SEASON**\n\nPlot twist - Jan Urban was sacked in June. The true reasons aren't exactly known, maybe he was too much of an independent thinker for Zabrze politicians, maybe they thought they can challenge for Europe. Don't look for logic in that. Urban was replaced by Bartosch Gaul, who recently worked for FSV Mainz II in the German 4th tier. Moreover, they signed keeper Kevin Broll (Dynamo Dresden) and defender Jonatan Kotzke (FC Ingolstadt). Podolski's influence is getting bigger even outside of the pitch - Gaul and Broll are also Germans of Polish origin. G\u00f3rnik's defence was severely weakened - they lost Przemys\u0142aw Wi\u015bniewski (Venezia) and Adrian Gryszkiewicz (SC Paderborn).\n\n**POSSIBLE LINEUP**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uedod7iasib91.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5bfeee9f0665b084c9882c87561b8df5d237739\n\n**INTERESTING PLAYERS**\n\n**Lukas Podolski** \\- the first WC winner in history of Ekstraklasa needed a few months to get in form last season. This time, he's expected to provide quality immediately.\n\n**Bartosz Nowak** \\- great playmaker recently linked with Rak\u00f3w. Selling him would be a big loss for G\u00f3rnik.\n\n**Pawe\u0142 Olkowski** \\- former Polish international comes back to Zabrze after 8 years. The right-back previously played for FC K\u00f6ln, Bolton Wanderers and Gazi\u015fehir Gaziantep.\n\n**Krzysztof Kubica** \\- young box to box midfielder scored 9 goals last season including... 8 headers.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT**\n\n**The middle.** I'm not sure what G\u00f3rnik is aiming for, they have worse defence and less experienced coach than the last time. Sacking Urban suggests they were unhappy with 8th place, but it's unlikely that this season will be significantly better.\n\n# [Jagiellonia Bia\u0142ystok](https://jagiellonia.pl/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Herb_Jagiellonii.png)\n\n**Coach:** [Maciej Stolarczyk](https://pzpn.pl/public/system/images/articles/8732/12436-zoom.jpg?ts=e1b693fd2a9a6c9b58635f594047fd66)\n\n**Debut:** 1987/88\n\n**Biggest achievement:** Runners-up (2 times: 2016/17, 2017/18)\n\n**Last season:** 12th\n\n**Nickname:** The Yellow-Reds, *Jaga*\n\n**Stadium:** [Bia\u0142ystok City Stadium (22 372)](https://d-pt.ppstatic.pl/k/r/1/7a/8a/5902dee3e0f01_p.jpg?1510239299)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**OVERSIMPLIFIED HISTORY**\n\nWhile Jagiellonia is over 100 year old, their debut in the highest tier came only in the late 1980s. In 1992/93 Bia\u0142ystok team was relegated for another 14 years, but since 2007/08 they are Ekstraklasa regulars. Their golden age came in the mid 2010s - Jaga took 3rd place in 2014/15, then challenged for the title in 2016/17 and 2017/18, ultimately finishing 2nd. From the modern point of view, it was a lost opportunity. The club is currently on the decline, finishing 5th, 8th, 9th and 12th in the last 4 seasons. What caused their sudden rise and fall? The short answer is, their chairman Cezary Kulesza (currently the chairman of Polish FA) had great instincts and ability to pick right people... until he lost it. Oversimplified, but this is oversimplified history after all!\n\n**LAST SEASON**\n\n|Position|Points|W|D|L|GF|GA|GD|Biggest win|Biggest defeat|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|12|40|9|13|12|39|50|\\-11|3-0 vs Rak\u00f3w|0-5 vs Rak\u00f3w|\n\nJagiellonia brought back Ireneusz Mamrot, the coach who achieved 2nd place with them in 2017/18. His second tenure wasn't nearly as successful and he got fired shortly before Christmas (a few hours earlier [weszlo.com](https://weszlo.com) published an interview with vice-chairman of Jagiellonia board, who claimed that coach's job is not in danger). Mamrot was replaced by Piotr Nowak, former manager of MLS clubs who recently was known more as a pundit than an active coach. Somehow, Jagiellonia managed to get involved in the relegation race, although they were never in a *really* big danger of going down. One of the main reasons why this season was so bad was the ACL injury of their best player Jes\u00fas Imaz, who came back only in the final weeks.\n\n**THIS SEASON**\n\nExpectedly Piotr Nowak was sacked (and players are openly criticizing him in the media, which is a rare occurance in Ekstraklasa) and replaced by Maciej Stolarczyk, who recently managed Poland U21. His team was known for inconsistency - they could beat Germany 4-0 away, but also lose 1-2 to Israel at home. The most notable transfer of the window is Portuguese midfielder Nen\u00e9, who was a regular starter at CD Santa Clara. He will replace Karol Struski, youngster sold to Cypriot AEL Limassol. Imaz signed a new contract, which is probably the best news of the summer (at one point his departure was almost certain).\n\n**POSSIBLE LINEUP**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4re41t6esib91.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=591692d70bf53e340955384c2d2ee0a5e3251255\n\n**INTERESTING PLAYERS**\n\n**Jes\u00fas Imaz** \\- Jagiellonia's best striker, playmaker and winger depending on what you need. Who knows, maybe if it wasn't for his injury, Mamrot would be still working.\n\n**Marc Gual** \\- Spanish striker joined the club after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine and immediately provided quality Jaga needed in attack. His potential partnership with Imaz looks promising.\n\n**Micha\u0142 Pazdan** \\- national hero after his performances on EURO 2016 is past his prime, but he's still one of the better centre-backs in the league.\n\n**Taras Romanczuk** \\- Ethnically a Ukrainian, Jagiellonia's captain came to Poland in 2013 and even managed to get one cap for Polish NT in 2018 after obtaining citizenship.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT**\n\n**The middle.** Jagiellonia is not good enough for Europe and not bad enough for another season like the last one. All they have to do is to wrap Imaz in the bubble wrap.\n\n# [Korona Kielce](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/tmobile-ekstraklasa/images/f/f2/Korona_Kielce_herb.png/revision/latest?cb=20130718123629&amp;path-prefix=pl)\n\n**Coach:** [Leszek Ojrzy\u0144ski](https://d-art.ppstatic.pl/kadry/k/r/1/fd/79/6280246a1decb_o_large.jpg)\n\n**Debut:** 2005/06\n\n**Biggest achievement:** 5th (3 times: 2005/06, 2011/12, 2016/17)\n\n**Last season:** 4th (I Liga)\n\n**Nickname:** The Buck Knives, The Golden-Blooded\n\n**Stadium:** [Suzuki Arena (15 500)](https://radiokielce.pl/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/dji-0608-145044-195042.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**OVERSIMPLIFIED HISTORY**\n\nKorona made their debut in Ekstraklasa in the 2000s, when they were owned by wealthy businessman Krzysztof Klicki. At that time they finished regularly in the upper half of the table. The situation has changed when Klicki quitted and the club was taken over by the city of Kielce. In the 2010s Korona turned into the most successful \"Final Destination\" character and avoided relegation every year despite being the main candidate to go down. The 2011-13 period redefined club's identity as [\"The Crazy Gang\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Gang_(football)) \\- Polish equivalent of Wimbledon F.C. In 2017 Korona was sold to shady German investors who almost killed the club entirely in just 3 years. Since the relegation in 2020, Korona is owned by the city again.\n\n**LAST SEASON**\n\n|Position|Points|W|D|L|GF|GA|GD|Biggest win|Biggest defeat|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|4|56|15|11|8|46|37|\\+9|4-1 vs Skra|2-5 vs Puszcza|\n\nThe season started impressively as Korona won 6 out of the first 6 games. Then their form started declining, which led to a huge crisis in the late autumn. Dominik Nowak was sacked and replaced by Leszek Ojrzy\u0144ski, who is regarded as the club's greatest manager in history. He previously coached Korona in their \"crazy gang\" era. It was a bit desperate move, but it paid off. The spring wasn't great and in the last few weeks the club from Kielce lost the chances for direct promotion, but they were able to get in form when it mattered the most. Korona beat Odra (3-0) and Chrobry (3-2) in the play-offs and returned to Ekstraklasa after 2 year break.\n\n**THIS SEASON**\n\nKorona returns to their traditional role of an underdog, which wasn't the case in I Liga. Their goal is to simply survive and remain in the league. The main arguments for Korona staying up are based on history - this club is famous for avoiding relegation and moreover they also have a manager who is famous for avoiding relegation. The main arguments against are... everything else. Despite promotion, they didn't look great even in I Liga. The squad isn't impressive either (although it consists of very experienced players who already spent years in Ekstraklasa - that could be an advantage over other newly promoted teams).\n\n**POSSIBLE LINEUP**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kstin0ghsib91.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ab895f9bd99682d5cde32d2a5abfb13b058c163\n\n**INTERESTING PLAYERS**\n\n**Jacek Kie\u0142b** \\- can you become a club legend if you leave it 3 times? Yes, if you always come back. Korona's captain was infamous for being underwhelming in every other club, but the decisive goal against Chrobry in the play-offs final cemented his status.\n\n**Dawid B\u0142anik** \\- Korona is weirdly strong on the wings compared to other positions, but one player who deserves a mention in particular is B\u0142anik - arguably the best left-winger or I Liga last season.\n\n**Bartosz \u015api\u0105czka** \\- last season the striker managed to score 11 goals for G\u00f3rnik \u0141\u0119czna, the worst team of the league. In Korona his situation will be similar.\n\n**Sa\u0161a Bali\u0107** \\- Montenegrin international joined Korona after 5 years in Zag\u0142\u0119bie. As an aggressive defender who gets cards in almost every match, he fits Ojrzy\u0144ski's team characterologically.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT**\n\n**Serious relegation threat.** What can I say, they can't get anything more. Even though history proves they can't be counted out, Korona is - as usual - one of the main candidates to go down this season.\n\n# [Lech Pozna\u0144](https://seeklogo.com/images/K/KKS_Lech_Poznan-logo-CC8C614ED3-seeklogo.com.png)\n\n**Coach:** [John van den Brom](https://galaktycznyfutbol.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/brom.jpg)\n\n**Debut:** 1948\n\n**Biggest achievement:** Champions (8 times: 1982/83, 1983/84, 1989/90, 1991/92, 1992/93, 2009/10, 2014/15, 2021/22)\n\n**Last season:** 1st\n\n**Nickname:** The Railwayman, *Lechici*\n\n**Stadium:** [Pozna\u0144 Stadium (41 609)](http://stadiony.net/pictures/stadiums/pol/stadion_lecha_poznan/stadion_lecha_poznan02.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**OVERSIMPLIFIED HISTORY**\n\nFounded in 1922, Lech celebrated its 100th birthday this year. The club played in the highest tier in the 1940s, 1950s and then since 1970s onward. As you could see above, Lech had two short periods of dominance in Polish football - early 1980s and early 1990s. In 21st century their titles are less regular and they win them every few years. In 2010/11 the club had a great campaign in Europa League, the most memorable results include 3-1 vs Manchester City and 3-3 vs Juventus. Nevertheless, in the last few years Lech became known as a frustrating team which brings their fans depression instead of joy. Well, until last season.\n\n**LAST SEASON**\n\n|Position|Points|W|D|L|GF|GA|GD|Biggest win|Biggest defeat|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|74|22|8|4|67|24|\\+43|5-0 vs Wis\u0142a and Termalica|1-2 vs Radomiak|\n\nMaciej Skor\u017ca managed Lech when they last won the title in 2014/15. Then, after few years of failed experiments, he was invited back and... won the title again. It wasn't easy though - the Pozna\u0144 club dominated in the autumn, but wasted their lead in the early spring. The three horse race between Lech, Rak\u00f3w and Pogo\u0144 was the most interesting in years. The atmosphere became terrible when Lech lost 1-3 to Rak\u00f3w in the cup final. And then, unexpectedly, Rak\u00f3w started bottling. Lech kept the pressure - something that wasn't common in recent history - and won the first championship in 7 years. Skor\u017ca became the most titled manager in the league history by winning his 4th title.\n\n**THIS SEASON**\n\nPreparations to the new season started in the worst way possible - Maciej Skor\u017ca resigned due to personal problems. While the actual reason was never stated, most likely someone from his close family is severely ill. Skor\u017ca was replaced by Dutch manager John van den Brom, who worked for various Eredivisie clubs. Lech spent \u20ac1.2M for Portugal U21 midfielder Alfonso Sousa from Belenenses SAD. On the other side, they sold Poland NT winger Jakub Kami\u0144ski to Wolfsburg for \u20ac10M. Lech looks great in all positions but one. There is one significant problem. Goalkeepers. Mickey van der Hart, the starting keeper in the last season, left the club and even he was a bit problematic. Second keeper Filip Bednarek is also seen as someone \"not good enough for club like Lech\". So what did they do? They signed Artur Rudko, 30 year old guy from Cypriot Pafos FC. On Tuesday Lech lost 1-5 to Qarabag and was eliminated from CL Qualifiers. You can guess what was the biggest (but not the only!) reason.\n\n**POSSIBLE LINEUP**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dchy6ja0tib91.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c87090d5228c35b53f0eace2694738de11d368ad\n\n**INTERESTING PLAYERS**\n\n**Mikael Ishak** \\- Lech captain is the best striker of Ekstraklasa and one of the main reasons why the team had an advantage over Rak\u00f3w and Pogo\u0144, which had less impressive players on that position.\n\n**Jo\u00e3o Amaral** \\- team's best player last season. Amaral joined Lech already in 2018, but he reached his best form when Skor\u017ca moved him from the right wing to the attacking midfield.\n\n**Alfonso Sousa** \\- the biggest transfer of the league in this window. Portuguese central midfielder is supposed to be Lech's key player - otherwise they wouldn't spend so much money (and yes, for Ekstraklasa standards it is a lot).\n\n**Bartosz Salamon** \\- experienced defender spent most of his career in Serie A clubs and it shows. He's been already called up for the WC play-offs, but injury stopped him from taking part in it (and weakened Lech in the last weeks of the season).\n\n**FINAL VERDICT**\n\n**Title contenders.** No surprises here, Lech is supposed to fight for the highest goals internally with that squad. What can possibly stop them? Losing apparently the only coach who can make this club work and long involvement in European competitions (optimistic assumption).\n\n# [Lechia Gda\u0144sk](https://lechia.pl/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Lechia_Gdan%CC%81sk_herb1519033998.png)\n\n**Coach:** [Tomasz Kaczmarek](https://d-art.ppstatic.pl/kadry/k/r/1/08/5c/6162dc8f71c37_o_original.jpg)\n\n**Debut:** 1949\n\n**Biggest achievement:** 3rd (2 times: 1956, 2018/19)\n\n**Last season:** 4th\n\n**Nickname:** The White-Greens, *Lechi\u015bci*\n\n**Stadium:** [Polsat Plus Arena (41 620)](http://nol.hu/data/cikk/1/29/13/67/cikk_1291367/755598.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**OVERSIMPLIFIED HISTORY**\n\nLechia was founded in 1945 and looking at their history we can notice an interesting pattern - their biggest successes come every 30 years. Specifically we are talking about 1950s, 1980s and 2010s. The club took the 3rd place in Ekstraklasa in 1956. After the relegation in 1962/63 Lechia spent over 20 years in the lower leagues, but came back in the 1980s. In 1983/84 the team from Gda\u0144sk faced Juventus in the European Cup Winners Cup, losing 0-7 away and 2-3 at home. A few years later Lechia got relegated again, but ultimately became an Ekstraklasa regular after 2008/09. Moreover, since 2013/14 the team quite often takes part in European qualifiers. Lechia's best shot at winning the league so far was 2018/19, but ultimately they wasted their lead and finished 3rd.\n\n**LAST SEASON**\n\n|Position|Points|W|D|L|GF|GA|GD|Biggest win|Biggest defeat|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|4|57|16|9|9|52|39|\\+13|4-0 vs \u0141\u0119czna|1-5 vs Pogo\u0144|\n\nThe season started surprisingly to say the least - Piotr Stokowiec, who led Lechia to some of their biggest achievements in history, got sacked just after 6 games. The results weren't even bad, but the board's bold decision paid off. Stokowiec was replaced by Tomasz Kaczmarek, who made the team more offensive minded and entertaining. Players deemed as average or finished fastly got back in form. Lechia wasn't exactly consistent (best examples include 1-5 vs Pogo\u0144 followed by 3-1 vs Rak\u00f3w or 1-0 vs Lech followed by 0-2 vs Radomiak), but good enough for finishing 4th and playing in Europe again.\n\n**THIS SEASON**\n\n*It was a great year, I will never forget it. And what do I wish for myself in the new one? The same as in the old one.* The classic Polish video with new year's wishes summarizes Lechia's ambitions the best. The team is probably not good enough to compete with the top 3, but finishing 4th again is a realistic goal. Realistic, but harder - the competition looks stronger while the team's squad has barely changed so far. Counting significant players only, Lechia sold Swedish winger Joseph Ceesay to Malm\u00f6 and bought the best youngster of I Liga, Dominik Pi\u0142a from Chrobry. Aside from that, everything looks roughly the same. So far, because the transfer window will remain open till the end of August.\n\n**POSSIBLE LINEUP**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ygz7lfhatib91.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb4375dc842ca1f002b28e2133e1d9390475cb2c\n\n**INTERESTING PLAYERS**\n\n**Fl\u00e1vio Paix\u00e3o** \\- since the last season Lechia's captain is not only the legend of the club, but also the legend of the league as a whole. Portuguese forward became the first foreigner to score 100 goals in Ekstraklasa.\n\n**\u0141ukasz Zwoli\u0144ski** \\- as if Paix\u00e3o wasn't enough, Lechia has the best Polish striker of the league too. Zwoli\u0144ski was recently rumoured to leave Ekstraklasa, but at the moment of writng this nothing has happened.\n\n**Du\u0161an Kuciak** \\- although he may not be in his prime anymore, Slovakian international is the best foreign keeper in history of the league.\n\n**Dominik Pi\u0142a** \\- according to people who followed I Liga closely (admittedly I wasn't very passionate about Chrobry G\u0142og\u00f3w), the left-winger was the best youngster of the season in the second tier.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT**\n\n**Europe contenders.** This category means being involved in the race for the European spots.

The club played in the league since its formation and suffered its only relegation in history in 1936. 2 years later, the football section of Legia was completely dissolved. In 1945 it was reactivated while in 1949 Polish People's Army became the patron of the team. It was also renamed to CWKS (Central Army Sports Club) Warszawa. Legia won the most championships in history of Ekstraklasa, including almost half of them (7 out of 15) in the last 10 years. The 2010s were a period of rarely interrupted domination of the club from Warsaw. Legia is also the only Polish club to play in Champions League twice (1995/96 and 2016/17).\n\n**LAST SEASON**\n\n|Position|Points|W|D|L|GF|GA|GD|Biggest win|Biggest defeat|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|10|43|13|4|17|46|48|\\-2|4-0 vs Zag\u0142\u0119bie|1-4 vs Piast|\n\nThe last season wasn't just a disaster - it was the worst one in 30 years. Everything started well - Legia had a good run in Europe, they eliminated Bod\u00f8/Glimt and Slavia in qualifiers and ended up in Europa League. The problems began with that competition. Legia was able to beat Spartak and Leicester, but at the same time the results in the league kept getting worse. Situation got even worse after traditional autumn managerial sack. Czes\u0142aw Michniewicz was at least able to provide results in Europe, under Marek Go\u0142\u0119biewski even that declined immediately. Finally chairman Dariusz Mioduski decided to use the \"ol' reliable\" - Aleksandar Vukovi\u0107. Serb, who already worked for Legia many times before, saved the champions from the possibility of embarassing relegation, but wasn't offered to stay for the next season.\n\n**THIS SEASON**\n\nVukovi\u0107 was replaced by German manager Kosta Runjai\u0107, who spent 5 years in Pogo\u0144 and turned them from a midtable club into title contenders. In theory he is competent enough for this job. Legia can't afford missing Europe for the second time in a row, however winning the league would be a surprise. Not some historical shock, but a surprise nevertheless. Legia got rid of some players who weren't good enough, but the squad will mostly consist of the same people. The biggest transfer to the club is Makana Baku, German winger remembered for being a key player for Warta 2 seasons ago. We can suspect Legia will put an extraordinary effort into winning the cup this season for obvious reasons.\n\n**POSSIBLE LINEUP**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0on1scbhtib91.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf302bec5010555cb55fc18cb85b281bda222112\n\n**INTERESTING PLAYERS**\n\n**Josu\u00e9** \\- being \"the best player in the league outside of top 3\" is a specific honor, but still a honor. Portuguese midfielder's form was the key to keeping Legia in Ekstraklasa, which he ensured with 14 assists.\n\n**Bartosz Kapustka** \\- the wonderkid from EURO 2016 comes back after a year long injury. Midfielder is famously loved by Czes\u0142aw Michniewicz, so the ticket to Qatar is not out of question.\n\n**Mateusz Wieteska** \\- speaking of Michniewicz's favorites, Wieteska recently made his debut for Poland despite having a terrible season. Now, as a new captain, he will be responsible for keeping Legia's defence in better shape than the last time.\n\n**Pawe\u0142 Wszo\u0142ek** \\- right winger already joined Legia on the loan from Union Berlin in the winter, but now he's coming back permanently. Wszo\u0142ek's presence was another reason why Legia got better in the spring.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT**\n\n**Europe contenders.** I will put it simply - it's possible to imagine Legia finishing above Pogo\u0144 **or** Rak\u00f3w **or** Lech, but hard to imagine Legia finishing above Pogo\u0144 **and** Rak\u00f3w **and** Lech. Coming back to European competitions is a more realistic goal - even their players admit it.\n\n# [Mied\u017a Legnica](https://i.iplsc.com/miedz-legnica/0007GXPUFEO967FK-C122-F4.jpg)\n\n**Coach:** [Wojciech \u0141obodzi\u0144ski](https://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/CA9k9kpTURBXy82OTk3ODEyZWVlOWJkMmZkNWNkNGQyMDM3MTQ3ZTA4Ni5qcGeSlQMAd80O-c0IbJMFzQMMzQFogaEwBQ)\n\n**Debut:** 2018/19\n\n**Biggest achievement:** 15th (2018/19)\n\n**Last season:** 1st (I Liga)\n\n**Nickname:** *Miedzianka*\n\n**Stadium:** [White Eagle Stadium (6 194)](http://stadiony.net/pictures/stadiums/pol/stadion_miedzi_legnica/stadion_miedzi_legnica35.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**OVERSIMPLIFIED HISTORY**\n\nFounded in 1971, Mied\u017a spent most of their history in 2nd and 3rd tiers. However, they had a moment of glory - in 1991/92 they surprisingly won the Polish Cup. As a prize, Mied\u017a took part in the UEFA Cup Winners Cup, in which they lost 0-1 and drew 0-0 with AS Monaco. In 2018 the club advanced to Ekstraklasa for the first time in history, but despite decent autumn, they finished 15th and got relegated back. Mied\u017a was extraordinarily unlucky with injuries, which caused a huge part of their problems. In I Liga, the club came back to the role of eternal candidates to promotion.\n\n**LAST SEASON**\n\n|Position|Points|W|D|L|GF|GA|GD|Biggest win|Biggest defeat|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|77|23|8|3|56|22|\\+34|4-0 vs Sosnowiec|0-3 vs Stomil|\n\nNo one in recent history dominated I Liga as hard as Mied\u017a. Even famously strong (and \"strong\") promoted teams didn't make it that easy. What's the main reason of their rise? Above all, their scouting. It's frankly insane what kind of players they could find despite being a not that rich club from Polish second tier. Another reason of their rise is the patience of the owner. Andrzej Dade\u0142\u0142o is simply level-headed. He drew conclusions from the relegation and gave himself a few years to rebuild the team. Compare that to the club like \u0141KS, which desperately tried to come back after one year. Mied\u017a is managed by Wojciech \u0141obodzi\u0144ski who basically unblocks a new achievement every year. Since relegation in 2019, he turned from a player into a player-assistant at Mied\u017a II, an assistant at Mied\u017a, a manager at Mied\u017a II and a manager at Mied\u017a. Simple yet effective evolution.\n\n**THIS SEASON**\n\nThe situation of Mied\u017a is very unusual. Usually the goal of newly promoted teams is just to stay up, but Mied\u017a is the most hyped promoted team in recent memory. When you look at the predictions, a lot of people have them in the upper half. To be fair, there is a reason why this is happening. In the last two years, we had two promoted teams that were relatively close to European spots - Warta (2020/21) and Radomiak (2021/22). The situation became weirdly normalized and Mied\u017a is a perfect candidate to continue this new \"tradition\". What are the arguments against? I can't find many, but there is one important. Usually the praised promoted teams flop (Podbeskidzie, \u0141KS, even Mied\u017a last time). Warta and Radomiak were actual surprises - Mied\u017a wouldn't be.\n\n**POSSIBLE LINEUP**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0qhincyltib91.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4957de74c1e5cd3a32b73edce678d5779ee715f\n\n**INTERESTING PLAYERS**\n\n**\u00c1ngelo Henr\u00edquez** \\- former Manchester United and Dinamo Zagreb striker who won Copa America with Chile in 2015. *Least interesting Mied\u017a transfer.*\n\n**Maxime Dominguez** \\- the best midfielder of I Liga last season, somehow decided to leave Switzerland for Polish 2nd tier.\n\n**Jer\u00f3nimo Cacciabue** \\- [Argentinian defensive midfielder loaned from Newell's Old Boys.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/914/422/cb7.jpg)\n\n**Olaf Kobacki** \\- finally something more down to earth. If Pi\u0142a was the best youngster of I Liga, Kobacki was second. He's loaned from Arka, who failed to get promoted.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT**\n\n**Potential positive surprise.** Assuming we can call it a surprise. As the old discussion point goes: \"Is it really a dark horse when people expect it?\". Oh boy, I made a lot of predictions today, but I will look especially stupid if Mied\u017a gets relegated.\n\n# [Piast Gliwice](http://kronika-futbolu.pl/historia/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/piast-gliwice.jpg)\n\n**Coach:** [Waldemar Fornalik](https://i.iplsc.com/waldemar-fornalik/0007OS4GRBBL4RJG-C122-F4.jpg)\n\n**Debut:** 2008/09\n\n**Biggest achievement:** Champions (2018/19)\n\n**Last season:** 5th\n\n**Nickname:** The Nurses\n\n**Stadium:** [Gliwice City Stadium (9 913)](http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/96/0d/15/z22075030V,Stadion-Piasta-Gliwice.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**OVERSIMPLIFIED HISTORY**\n\nAnother Silesian club founded after World War II. Piast spent most of their history in the lower tiers, making their debut in Ekstraklasa in 2008/09. However, despite being relatively new, they fastly became quite relevant. Piast's successes used to be irregular: 4th place in 2012/13, two average seasons, 2nd place in 2015/16, two average seasons (including narrowly escaping relegation) and finally the shocking championship in 2018/19. After winning the most unexpected title of 21st century, club's results become more stable - in the last 3 seasons they finished 3rd, 6th and 5th.\n\n**LAST SEASON**\n\n|Position|Points|W|D|L|GF|GA|GD|Biggest win|Biggest defeat|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|5|54|15|9|10|45|37|\\+8|4-1 vs Legia|2-4 vs Cracovia|\n\nIn the last two seasons, Piast faced similar problem - bad results in the autumn. For some unknown reason, the team gets in form only after the winter break, but that's not enough to get that precious European spot. Truth be told, the squad was stronger in the spring too - Piast had a good winter transfer window, their most important signing was Kamil Wilczek, who came back after 7 years spent mostly in Danish league. Not much more can be said - nowadays Piast is a synonym of a stable club, managers don't get sacked every 4 months there. In fact, the team is still coached by Waldemar Fornalik, who works there since 2017. For Ekstraklasa standards, this is a Ferguson level experience.\n\n**THIS SEASON**\n\nIf Lechia didn't change much, Piast changed for the worse. Right-back Martin Konczkowski left the club after 5 years, leaving a hole on the right side. Arkadiusz Pyrka, who will most likely start as a RWB, is a young winger not known for his defending abilities. Piast signed midfielder Grzegorz Tomasiewicz from Stal, but arguably their biggest success was keeping the team's star Damian K\u0105dzior, who was strongly linked with Lech. The main hope for finishing on European spots lays in signing a new right-back who can properly replace Konczkowski and in remembering that season starts in July, not February. As a league veteran, Fornalik can probably draw conclusions from the past.\n\n**POSSIBLE LINEUP**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/soqvl34wtib91.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a865670079c37a3124eadf7667247e4dcc98e57\n\n**INTERESTING PLAYERS**\n\n**Damian K\u0105dzior** \\- former Dinamo Zagreb right-winger known for his crosses is a key player of the team. Lech can live without him, but Piast would have a problem.\n\n**Kamil Wilczek** \\- 2014/15 Ekstraklasa top scorer came back to Piast in the winter. Wilczek had great statistics in Denmark, but caused controversy as he played both for Br\u00f8ndby and Copenhagen.\n\n**Ariel Mos\u00f3r** \\- the best young defender in the league, it's most likely his last season in Ekstraklasa.\n\n**Tihomir Kostadinov** \\- North Macedonia international was another winter signing. He looked well, but suffered an injury. This season, his impact should be bigger.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT**\n\n**Europe contenders.** Piast has significant problems on the right side, but I can't really put them in one category with midtable clubs like Jagiellonia or P\u0142ock (spoiler alert: P\u0142ock will be midtable). I believe they will sign someone sooner or later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's all for today. Hope you enjoyed the read, tomorrow we will discuss another 9 clubs."}
