I was very excited to see a bunch of citations of empirical papers that supposedly verify the MMT model! Were finally done with accounting and the MMTers are ready to do science. \n\nLets take a look at these papers. \n\n# [Elmendorf 96](https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/1996/199627/199627pap.pdf)\n\nOur MMTer says:\n\n&gt;**Douglas W. Elmendorf**, writing for the Federal Reserve Board in June 1996, performed a comprehensive review of the literature and additional empirical research into whether **raising interest rates actually increased household saving**. He found that while there was some reason to believe that households increase saving when interest rates increase, **the evidence as to the magnitude and reliability of this response was mixed at best**. Because the factors mentioned above vary widely across households, he concluded that **\u201cit is simply not possible to provide a precise estimate of the interest elasticity of saving with any confidence.\u201d** The most sober analysis of the effect of rate hikes implies that we should be looking at other solutions as well.\n\nOh no that's not consistent with standard macro. Rate hikes should increase personal savings and decrease consumption and investment. But wait... that was not the only conclusion of the paper. That was Elmendorf's paper from the \"lit review\" part of the paper. In 1996, nearly 3 decades ago, we just weren't sure if rate hikes increase saving. But that's not the only thing Elmendorf did, he also did some original research in this paper:\n\n&gt;Despite the uncertainty, **the models that likely describe the behavior of the people who\naccount for most of aggregate saving imply positive interest elasticities**. Thus, the paper's second\nconclusion is that **the short-run interest elasticity of saving is probably positive. A basic lifecycle\nmodel with empirically-supported parameters easily generates an elasticity around 0.5**, although\nthe magnitude is sensitive to the exact parameter choices. Adding uncertainty to the basic model\nreduces the absolute value of the elasticity, perhaps significantly, **but it does not transform\npositive elasticities into negative ones**. Adding altruistic bequests to the lifecycle model increases\nthe elasticity, although other, probably less important, motives for leaving bequests have the\nopposite effect. Target saving--including saving behavior suggested by many financial planners--\nimplies a significant negative interest elasticity of saving, but there is at least some evidence that\nmany people respond to interest rates in a way not predicted by the target-saving model. Rule of-thumb consumers may contribute to a positive or negative interest elasticity of saving,\ndepending on the types of assets and liabilities they hold. It is unlikely, however, that these\npeople do a large enough share of aggregate consumption or saving to have a substantial effect\non the aggregate elasticity. **In sum, the combination of theory and empirical evidence suggests\non balance that the aggregate interest elasticity of saving is unlikely to be negative, and may be\nsubstantially positive**.\n\nOur MMTer had an *extremely* disingenuous reading of Elmendorf. The actual conclusion of the paper was the exact the opposite of what our MMTer implied. Kinda rough, but there are many more papers in this blog post. Maybe the next one might even be from the current century?\n\n# [Stavins 96](https://www.bostonfed.org/-/media/Documents/neer/neer496c.pdf) \n \nOh okay were still working with really old papers. That's fine. Our MMTer cites this paper to claim \n\n&gt; Joanna Stavins, writing for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, found that **when the policy rate decreases, credit card APRs remain high because banks can adjust annual fees and \u201cbells and whistles\u201d to remain profitable**. In addition, banks use high APRs to screen for lower risk customers, which increases their profits, giving them an incentive to keep APRs high even when the cost of funds decreases. **In other words, the amount of credit card debt is not a function of the central bank\u2019s policy rate, but of the risk profile of borrowers and the risk sensitivity of banks.**\n\nExcept, that's not what the paper says. They're estimating the demand curve for credit card loans. Yes they say that credit card interest rates are sticky in the short run, but they use a 3SLS estimator **with one year treasury rates as an instrument**. I assume that's what our MMTer meant when they say \"policy rate\". That stage of the regression implies [monetary policy rates do affect APR](https://i.imgur.com/CcYGZmu.png) according to their results. \n\nAs a side note, this paper is really bad. Treasury rates are clearly an invalid instrument for what they're trying to do it doesn't make any sense idk why this paper was included if they wanted to make MMT look good. \n\n# [Gaiotti and Secchi 06](https://www-jstor-org.auth.lib.niu.edu/stable/4123042?seq=1)\n\nAlright our MMTer finally made it into the current century. This paper is all about a well known phenomenon called \"the price puzzle.\" I know a bit about this, it was tangentially relevant to my thesis research. Basically, there are a ton of papers that try to estimate the effect of interest rates on inflation. The economy is dynamic, interest rate changes dont just impact the economy today, they impact the economy tomorrow and the day after that. When the Fed hikes interest rates, there is a strange thing that happens in the periods immediately following the rate hike - we get no change in inflation and sometimes there is even a small *increase* in inflation\n\nWhat explains the price puzzle? Listen AFAIK, this is an open problem in macro right now. You'll have to ask someone with doctoral training in this stuff (/u/integralds might have thoughts). Regardless, the use of the price puzzle this context is misleading. Our MMTer implies that the price puzzle is evidence against the effectiveness of monetary policy:\n\n&gt;Eugenio Gaiotti and Alessandro Secchi, writing for the Journal of Money, Credit and Banking in December 2006 investigated over 2,000 Italian businesses and found \u201crobust and direct evidence\u201d that firms do in fact raise prices in response to interest rate hikes. In this way, rate hikes work in the exact opposite direction as intended. If firms are not able to pass this cost onto their customers and close, aggregate supply will reduce, which could put further upward pressure on the price level.\n\nFirst of all, the cost channel just attenuates the impact of monetary policy at best, which is why Gaiotti and Secchi explicitly say that on net in the medium run, rate hikes still decrease inflation:\n\n\n&gt;Firstly, our estimates suggest that over the whole sample the coefficie interaction variables hiArCA, hiArCR_ 1, hiArt in the price equation is between 0.3 and 1. Secondly, in our sample, hi, the mean ratio of working capital to annual operating\n costs is around 0.33. On average, then, firms hold four months worth of operating costs\n as working capital, which has to be financed. **As a consequence, a 1% rise in (annualized) interest rates may induce an increase in prices between 10 and 30 basis points.** Such an effect on prices, while not extraordinarily large, is not negligible.\n As a benchmark, in Italy during the three main monetary restrictions in the period\n 1988-1998, the overall average policy rate increase was between 3 and 5.5 percentage\n points. These figures would imply an overall adverse effect on prices ranging from 0.3\n to 1.6 percentage points, which would have partly counterbalanced the disinflationary\n effect operating through the demand side. **While hardly enough to change the\n overall effect of monetary policy on prices over the medium run**, this impact may not\n be without relevance.\n\nWhile its technically true that this might cause some small problems *if we only care about inflation*, the price puzzle actually implies monetary policy is *too strong* when it comes to stimulating output! It implies that the Fed can both stimulate output *and* decrease inflation at the same time. Dual mandate be damned we can actually solve both problems with the same monetary policy movements. This is evidence *against* MMT, not for it. The MMT argument is that interest rates don't affect the economy *[at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/mmt_economics/comments/uclvxp/mmt_criticisms/i6e6171/)*, not that theyre so effective at stimulating output that the effect on prices cancels out. Literally the next section of the blog post is about how interest rates don't stimulate investment. \n\n# [Sharpe and Suarez 14](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2014/files/201402r.pdf) \n\nAlright so as I said our MMTer is now using this paper to argue that firms investment decisions are not affected by policy rates. The Sharpe and Suarez paper is just a survey of CFOs. They just ask CFOs how their investment plans will change in response to interest rate decisions. Our MMTer wasn't dishonest or misunderstanding anything in the paper as far as I can tell. He is accurately telling you what the findings of the survey are. [Only a really small portion of CFOs say their decisions are affected by interest rates](https://i.imgur.com/6uE0LA8.png).\n\nThe problem is... its just not very compelling evidence for their claim that interest rates do not impact investment. \n\n1. Look at the 8% of firms who say they will change investment plans in response to a 1% rate hike. Why are we assuming that the 8% of firms are static? Firms change. Market conditions change. CFOs get new information. What if instead, we interpret this as an i.i.d random variable? This quarter, 92% of firms wont change investment plans in response to a 1% change in interest rates. How many will not change their plans in this quarter *or the next quarter*? Next quarter, that number will fall to 84.6%. In one year, 71.6%. In two years, almost half of all the firms surveyed would have considered changing investment plans at some point in the last two years in response to a 1% change in interest rates. Now do I expect this variable to be i.i.d? Obviously not, but expecting the firms choices to be static and unchanging is equally as absurd.\n2. The survey does not adjust for any measure of firm size when they're reporting these responses. If a firm with 100,000 employees is interest rate elastic but a firm with 1,000 employees is not, why would we count those firms equally if we are interested in the effect of interest rates in aggregate?\n3. [Cloyne et. al. 18](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25366/w25366.pdf) finds substantial heterogeneity in interest rate sensitivity. In particular, [\"young\" firms account for almost all of the increase in investment at the national level following interest rate cuts](https://i.imgur.com/RDqtwn9.png). Old firms barely change their behavior at all. In light of that heterogeneity, we need to ask ourselves if the Sharpe and Suarez data is a representative sample of firms in the United States. I doubt it. The data comes from [the Richmond Fed's CFO survey](https://www.richmondfed.org/-/media/RichmondFedOrg/research/national_economy/cfo_survey/the_cfo_survey_methods.pdf). They do make an effort make the sample representative in terms of geography, firm size, and sector but not firm age. Firm age is by far the most important firm characteristic for interest rate sensitivity according to the Cloyne et. al evidence. We know that a large number of firms appear to have interest rate inelastic demand curves but that does not mean the remaining firms aren't making up the bulk of the investment response. \n4. Sharpe and Suarez only look at what CFOs say they would do theoretically. Cloyne et. al. is based on *firm level microdata* on investment. If we can directly look at firms actual investment choices, I don't see much value added in looking at CFO responses to hypothetical thought experiments in a survey. We only have one quarter of data for the survey but Cloyne et. al. uses panel data from 1986 to 2016.\n\nI will congratulate our MMTer for not misrepresenting or misunderstanding one of the papers he's linked to so far. What's our next MMT paper he offers?\n\n# [Cochrane 16](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/conference/2016/woodford/cochrane_dohigherinterestratesraiseorlowerinflation)\n\nYea. That Cochrane. Budget hawk Cochrane with his FTPL model that shares many features of MMT yet implies that deficit spending destabilizes the price level. Our MMTer is using this paper to argue that interest rate hikes do not decrease inflation. And yes its true that FTPL has some NeoFisherian properties like that. But you can't just cite this paper without addressing the model behind it. The key reason *why* rate hikes can't control inflation is because FTPL treats budget deficits as catastrophic in a certain sense. I'll grant that Cochrane's paper is evidence against the mainstream view but its also inconsistent with MMT. \n\nThe remaining papers in the blog post also have issues like [the one he links for Europe](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp756.pdf) is literally just trying to revive old school Monetarism, but you get the picture. I\u2019ve spent too much time on this R1. \n\nIn conclusion, this is a common MMT rhetorical tactic. They will throw paper after paper after paper at you claiming that all the world's central banks agree with them. Then it turns out that when you start actually reading the papers, they don't say what MMTers think they're saying! Do not believe them when they make claims like this. Its almost always not consistent with MMT."}
