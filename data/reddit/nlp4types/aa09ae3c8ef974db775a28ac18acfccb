Part of GDPR is ensuring that those that process personal data on your behalf are also compliant. This means if you use a service that isn't compliant with GDPR, then you're not compliant with GDPR. And I've been looking for GDPR-compliant services recently and have been getting annoyed at the number of non-compliant sites claiming they are compliant.\n\nMost of the complaints getting taken to court are against small and medium size companies by consumer rights groups. You don't need to be big and have lots of users, you just need to end up on the radar of a consumer rights group.\n\nThe data needs to be hosted in countries that have GDPR-compliant laws. This means hosting data in the US is not allowed. Lots of US companies claim they're GDPR compliant because they use a data transfer agreement to transfer the data to the US. These were declared null and void by the EU courts. (See [https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2020-07/cp200091en.pdf](https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2020-07/cp200091en.pdf))\n\nGoogle Analytics was ruled illegal because Google is a US-based company and that a US court could force Google to hand over personal data under US spy laws, FISA specifically. This ruling has been decided in multiple EU countries and basically declares that any US-based company processing personal data is not GDPR compliant. No matter the technical measures they do to keep the data within the EU. (See [https://noyb.eu/en/austrian-dsb-eu-us-data-transfers-google-analytics-illegal](https://noyb.eu/en/austrian-dsb-eu-us-data-transfers-google-analytics-illegal))\n\nSo obivously, we need to use GDPR complaint tools to handle personal data and it's been ruled that the IP address is personal data so any javascript files you load in for your service provides must be GDPR complaint.\n\nHere are some tools I use to help stay GDPR compliant.\n\n## Analytics - Plausible.io\n\nI use plausible.io for my analytics.

It allows me to not have a cookie consent banner since it doesn't use cookies and only stores personal data when explicitly given consent.\n\nSite: [https://blether.chat](https://blether.chat)\n\n## Newsletters - Email Octopus\n\nMailchimp being ruled illegal due to the privacy shield being revoked was actually the reason I got into finding GDPR-compliant tools.\n\nOperated by a UK company with their servers within the EU.\n\nSite: [https://emailoctopus.com](https://emailoctopus.com)\n\n## Transactional emails - Rapidmail\n\nA German company with their servers in Germany.\n\nSite: [https://www.rapidmail.de/](https://www.rapidmail.de/)\n\n## Cloud Hosting - Hetzner\n\nMainly, I use their dedicated servers, but I also use their cloud servers to allow me to handle unexpected rapid growth in traffic.\n\nA German company with datacentres in Germany and Finnland.\n\nSite: [https://hetzner.de](https://hetzner.de)"}
