How is this relevant, you ask?\u00a0 Well, nuclear power plants use river water as coolant for the reactors.\u00a0 With lower flow, the waste heat from the reactors have a higher impact on the river temperatures, which are regulated as part of the program.\u00a0 French officials already allowed waste water to exceed allowed temperatures, but this may eventually be a limiting factor for power generation.\n\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/europe/frances-asn-nuclear-regulator-adapts-hot-water-discharge-rules-light-heatwave-2022-08-08/\n\n\nWhat is the impact of all of this?\n\n\nI\u2019m glad you asked.\u00a0 I tabulated data for France, Italy, and Germany as well as estimates for Europe as a whole to see what the impact of this ongoing squeeze on energy is over the next 6 months.\u00a0 I estimated the natural gas and electricity consumption for each month using historical data and calculated the cost of that consumption at the rate implied by that month\u2019s futures.\n\n\nNext, I calculated the \u201cExcess Cost\u201d which is simply the cost implied by futures and consumption minus the baseline cost for electricity and natural gas in previous years (75 Eur/MWh for electricity and 20 Eur/Mwh for natural gas).\n\nTo summarize, the calculation predicts excess costs between 12% and 18% of the annual GDP in only 6 months at historical consumption rates.  Naturally, consumption will drop due to prohibitively high prices, but the conclusion is clear: these prices are not compatible with a healthy or functiona economy \n\n\nAssumptions:\u00a0\n\n-Electricity Usage for each country is proportional to the electricity usage by month of Europe as a whole.\n\n-No change in consumption of natural gas or electricity (this is obviously false, but I have no way to predict what future usage will actually be this winter)\n\n-European electricity cost is the average of France, Italy, and Germany electricity futures.\n\n\nSources of Data:\n\nMonthly Eurozone Electricity Usage - https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Energy_statistics_-_latest_trends_from_monthly_data\n\n\nEurope Monthly Natural Gas Usage - https://www.allianz-trade.com/en_global/news-insights/economic-insights/europe-gas-imports-from-russia.html\n\n\nNatural Gas Prices - https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/energy/natural-gas/dutch-ttf-natural-gas-calendar-month.html\n\n\nFrance Electricity Prices - https://www.theice.com/products/57609947/French-Power-Financial-Base-Futures/data?marketId=5601613\n\n\nGermany Electricity Prices - https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/energy/electricity/german-power-baseload-calendar-month.html\n\n\nItalian Electricity Prices - https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/energy/electricity/italian-power-baseload-gme-calendar-month.html\n\n\nWhat happens now:\n\n\nThere are three non-mutually exclusive ways I can see this crisis resolving.\n\n\nEurope caves to Russia and removes sanctions/stops helping Ukraine to restore natural gas supply.\n\n\nEurope has a major recession (at the best) and possibly grinds to a halt (at the worst) due to the high energy prices and lack of availability of electricity and natural gas.\n\n\nEuropean governments subsidize electricity and natural gas with massive deficit spending in order to minimize impact to the population.\u00a0 This has already begun to happen.\u00a0 Source: https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/europes-efforts-shield-households-soaring-energy-costs-2022-08-15/\n\n\nHow do I make money off of this:\n\n\nIf you look at $EWG (german stock ETF, it is down 35% YTD already due to declines in the German stock market as well as relative strength of the dollar.
