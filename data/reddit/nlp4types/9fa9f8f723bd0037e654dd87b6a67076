Cycle lanes fit more people in the same road space than road space allocated to cars and take cars off the road. That also means less competition for parking spaces\n\n\n**Less govt expenditure (roads and health)** Bicycles cause a nearly negliegable amount of damage to roads compared to cars (look up fourth power law) and don't add health costs via pollution. Over 3000 people are dying early in NZ as a result of pollution mostly from cars. If we reduce the number of cars on the road, it means lower taxes for you. \n\n\n**Transport independence** Car getting too expensive to run? Are you sick of dropping off your 15 year old? Bicycles provide choices and that's especially important for people who don't have alternatives (ie kids and those who are struggling). That choice is only viable though if people don't feel like they are risking their lives by choosing to cycle.\n\n\n**Flexibility** Just like with a car, you can leave whenever you want and don't have to worry about timetables (hello there infrequent public transport!). When there are cycle lanes you don't have to worry about congestion. \n\n\n**More land for the things that matter** When you count up the space that we dedicate to roads and car parks especially it adds up. Car parking spaces in the Auckland region alone if lined up, would take you all the way to Adelaide. Dedicating a huge proportion of space in our cities for places that are empty most of the time is not a very productive use of space. \n\n\n**They make sense financially** A [study by the EU](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/378na1_en.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiHlo-_s6D5AhWF7jgGHVjeAL0QFnoECAUQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ebUBy_sCXNMMHOlL4sA7) based on data from Auckland showed cycling infrastructure projects can have a return on investment (ROI) of more than 20. In fact there is usually hardly any infrastructure to build apart from barriers, making them extremely cheap. Apart from pollution costs already mentioned, bicycles also mitigate health risks from our sedentary lifestyles. Rather than having to purposefully go to the gym, you can remain in shape just by going to work every day on your bike. Bicycles have a lot of benefits like these which are difficult to count.\n\n\n**An economy more resilient to external shocks** We've all seen the havoc that Putin's invasion has caused on economies all across the world. Bicycles can help us be less dependent on oil often sourced from authoritarian states (Russia, Saudi etc) and can therefore reduce the effect overseas politics has on our economy. \n\n\n**Quieter more people friendly streets** Quieter streets enable social connections by making it easier to hold conversations in public spaces. Fewer cars also make people outside cars including kids feel safer.\n\nMyths:\n\n\n**Nobody uses them** Whenever cycleways are installed there is usually a large jump in patronage. The ridership gets higher the closer you are to a complete network in which people feel safe throughout their entire journey. The current situation for cyclists is akin to mostly driving along a cliff's edge with no barriers and occasionally having a safe road. It's not too surprising that most people choose to not use them. Studies in Auckland where ridership is low have shown most people would cycle if it were safer. \n\n\n**Bicycle lanes kill business** A study in Canada (similar infrastructure to NZ) has shown most customers for businesses are local and come by foot or bike. Pedestrians and cyclists have also been found to spend more than consumers who arrived by car. \n\n\n**It's too hilly, rainy/windy or journey too long** For the hills and the long journeys there are e-bikes. And on the days it rains you could choose to take another mode of transport like a car or public transport. \n\n\nMost importantly\n\n\n**It's not bicycles or cars** No one is advocating to completely remove cars from streets. Cyclists just want the opportunity to get around safely just like drivers do. It's about having choices. People on bikes are cogniscent that cars play an especially important role in the mobility of the elderly and disabled. But the elderly and disabled shouldn't be used as an excuse to justify a sea of parking mostly used by the fit and healthy and which is preventing installation of a cycle lane."}
