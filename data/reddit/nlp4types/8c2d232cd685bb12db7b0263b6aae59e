Furthermore, the Erasmus University Rotterdam offers one of the most successful student mobility programs in the world.\n\n**Topic**: In our research project we seek to analyze the most important factors determining the Erasmus mobility flow, on a macro level. On a micro level, this would focus on the factors, influencing individual students to participate in the Erasmus program and go abroad to study at a different university. As the motivations to study abroad can take various forms, we will use the dataset stated above to understand which factors take the priority. The dataset provides information about different aspects of participants of Erasmus Mundus program, such as area of subject, age, level of study etc.\n\n**Academic Article**: One of the key articles related to this subject is written by Carlos Rodr\u0131guez Gonzalez, Ricardo Bustillo Mesanza and Petr Mariel (2011). This publication emphasizes on the question why the Erasmus mobility flow has risen in the last years. Using relevant hypotheses arising from the migration theory, this research tests the various factors such as such as the educational background of family, the distance between capitals, and the population of host country impacting on Erasmus the mobility flow. The study conducted by researchers points out that students' mobility can help EU to \u201cdevelop Europe\u2019s highly skilled labour force in order to strengthen its position as a knowledge-based economy\u201d (Rodr\u0131guez Gonzalez, Bustillo Mesanza &amp; Mariel, 2011, pp. 414). \n\n**Preliminary Research Questions**:\nWhat are factors that motivate students to go on exchange?\nWhat are the differences between bachelor and master students in their exchange motivations?\nWhat is the average time period that students go abroad?\nWhat is the most popular study program students follow during their Erasmus program?\nWhich country has the highest number of students who participate in the Erasmus programme?\n\n**References**\n\nEuropean Commission.
