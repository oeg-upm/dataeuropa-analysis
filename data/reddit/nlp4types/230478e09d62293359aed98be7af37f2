It's commonly discussed by both opponents and advocates of marriage that married partners are more likely to divorce with an increase in the number of sexual partners the wife has had. Many people have, as well, pointed out that some data in this field is a bit misleading, that it doesn't factor in the amount of time a female spouse spends with said sexual partners.\n\nHowever, if you notice the very subject's inherent nature, you know it's referring to *non-marital* partners, as opposed to other *martial* partners.\n\nSo, my question is, what are the chances that a first marriage will end in divorce, in contrast to the percentage of second marriages that end in divorce, and so on, and so on?\n\nI'm not at all concerned about pre-marital sex. In fact, it's not even a question of sexual activity at all. It's simply a question of what percentages of marriages end in divorce by total number of married partners one has, whether female or male.\n\nIt's an often cited statistic that fifty percent of all marriages end in divorce, but based upon my research, what I've gathered, first marriages are far less than fifty percent likely to end in divorce, but marriages after that tend to lead to more divorces, to the point where many marriages later have something like an eighty or ninety percent divorce rate. So, in other words, the more marriages a person has, the more likely such marriages will end with both partners getting a divorce.\n\nTo get that fifty percent statistic, you'd have to factor in all the people who only get married once, those who get married two or three times, and those who've gotten married an immense amount of times. The people who have excessive amounts of marriages, due to having extremely high divorce rates, tend to bring up the overall divorce rate by a lot. They're sort of an outlier.\n\nThe European Union government conducted a study which found that in some EU states, divorce rates outnumber the total amount of people residing within the territories. In Portugal, for instance, 94.4 percent of people who married got divorced (which includes all marriages a person has had. It means that for first marriages the rate is far below this, but later on, for excess marriages, the rate is even higher). 84.21 percent for Spain, 79.31 percent for Luxembourg, and 48.65 percent for the Netherlands.\n\n[EuroStat: Divorce Rates](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Divorces_13-05-2022.png)\n\nIf anyone could provide me with a bunch of statistics on this matter, that'd be great."}
