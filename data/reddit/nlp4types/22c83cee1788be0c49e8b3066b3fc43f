Going by the total january demand + industrial demand chart the total industrial demand is 2Twh x 31 days = 62Twh vs 140Twh in total, so slightly less than half, so a 10% reduction of industrial demand would translate into about 5% of total demand reduction - heating is kinda inelastic..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs long as imports stay above \\~2500Gwh/day, which would mean a 25% drop, Germany is gonna be fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of this obviously ignores other countries that might only be able to store a fraction of winter demand, but it looks like Europe might make it after all. At least on paper, ignoring the matter of actually having to pay for that gas...\n\nAnd yeah, I know that not every month has 31 days."}
