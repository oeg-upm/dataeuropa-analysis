So, if you are thinking about where to get the dataset for your AI project, it\u2019d be wise first to take a look around: maybe the perfect dataset is already waiting for you.\n\nA few things that you need to pay attention to are the following:\n\nIs it free or not? Open source datasets for machine learning are not rare. However, they may be too general or too specific to fit your project\u2019s goal. Make sure you\u2019re ready to make the necessary changes if you decide in favor of a ready-to-download dataset instead of collecting one yourself.\nWhat type of data do you need? Think about the purposes of your algorithm and what type of data you require. Then you can look through the available datasets to find the best fit.\nWhat type of machine learning and annotation tasks are you looking for? Facial recognition is very different from text classification or autonomous driving. The good news is that there are datasets for all of these, and many more, from general to specific tasks.\nIs your task very specific? Usually, the more specific the task, the harder it is to find the appropriate dataset that is ready to be used. Besides, designing an ML algorithm might also depend on the dataset to be used, so it\u2019s best to work both on the algorithm and finding and processing the data with Datatang\nAlso, consider if you need an annotated dataset (for supervised or semi-supervised machine learning tasks) or if you\u2019ll need no labeling (unsupervised learning tasks). It may be so that you\u2019ll find a suitable dataset that doesn\u2019t have the necessary labels. In that case, you\u2019ll need to spend time and resources on annotation.\n\nIt may be quite a fussy and labor-intensive task, however. If you wish to avoid the effort, don\u2019t hesitate to contact us, and we\u2019ll help you with both collecting and annotating the data that you need."}
