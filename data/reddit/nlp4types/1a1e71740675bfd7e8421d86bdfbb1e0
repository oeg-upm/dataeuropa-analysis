We can expect a partial collapse of european food chain to start next year. By partial collapse I mean long-term decrease of output of food production on European market driven by high market prices of raw materials. For consumers, it means:\n\n**TL;DR: we can expect food in Europe to be ca. 90%-120% more expensive by the same time next year at this moment.**\n\nWhy is that? Let's take a look at one of the best indicators, wheat price:\n\n[MATIF food prices since 2020](https://preview.redd.it/wix1172vhp991.png?width=1153&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6e48a7717db9445699fc3aa97063e0e148867b7)\n\nWhat we're experiencing now are the last year's price hikes of 25% and 27%. The same period this year was 90% and 76%. Wheat is a great agricultural market indicator, as it is used across multiple food industries from animal feed through bread to beer. But that is just the cost of the \"raw material\". Which brings us to energy:\n\n[Electricity costs across the EU 2012-2021 for non-households \\(companies\\)](https://preview.redd.it/gvd3do0gip991.png?width=1213&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0b9931e5ccf1cf1c53b1ba30407d0bf4ce1e886)\n\nNot too bad! Until the beginning of 2022, where the electricity prices got up drastically:\n\n[Average energy price per MWh in selected countries](https://preview.redd.it/ynynb0ixjp991.png?width=718&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12dfe336722ab76ad21f1cf0b7e6e18f35ff5c81)\n\nThe cost of energy per MWh has - on average - quadrupled since January 2020 in Europe. At the same time, 17% of entire energy supply is used in food production (*source: Monforti-Ferrario, F.; Pascua, I.; Motola, V.; Banja, M.; Scarlat, N.; Medarac, H.; Castellazzi, L.; Labanca, N.; Bertoldi, P.; Pennington, D. Energy Use in the EU Food Sector: State of Play and Opportunities for Improvement; Publications Office of the EU: Luxemburg, 2015*).\n\n**This means we can add ca. 20% to a possible price for the end customer just for the energy cost.**\n\nAnd once we produce food, we still need to transport it. And it's not at all peachy in petrol dept:\n\n[EUR per gallon price \\(diesel\\)](https://preview.redd.it/lok9mtjwlp991.png?width=1258&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d72091114c1df0c76df2f70282ba88f35539164)\n\nThe wholesale prices of petrol are much quicker to get to the end customer than raw material - mostly due to an immediate consumption and the price hikes are already there and are priced in. **However, if trends continue, we can expect to add another 20-30% to food price for end customer as there is no time to localize production of raw materials that quickly.**\n\nWe can expect a localization shift to happen (moving as much production to Europe as possible: [https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/more-europeans-want-stable-supply-food-eu-all-times-according-eurobarometer-2022-jun-21\\_en](https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/more-europeans-want-stable-supply-food-eu-all-times-according-eurobarometer-2022-jun-21_en)). The industries that consume the most raw materials for production and processing food will suffer the most, and most probably we can expect an economically-driven collapse of manufacturing capabilities of:\n\n1. Meat of all kinds\n2. Canned food (metal prices)\n3. All highly processed foods: white flour, white pasta, white bread, potato chips, soft drinks, sweetened breakfast cereals, reconstituted meat products (e.g., hot dogs), candy, cookies and cakes, bread\n\nFor end customers it means shortages in shops and supermarkets across Europe.\n\nWhy is that and why is partial collapse may happen next year?\n\n[Prices in 2015=100](https://preview.redd.it/gbc8bnsfsp991.png?width=1222&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3333220704d451d969f9923cde22497af0407a3)\n\nWithin 7 years, the prices for manufacturers have gotten higher by an estimated 30%. Not much? **A 20% price spike has happened since August 2021 to May 2022 and the manufacturers are already strained to keep up with production costs:** [https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/food-farming-fisheries/farming/documents/short-term-outlook-spring-2022\\_en.pdf](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/food-farming-fisheries/farming/documents/short-term-outlook-spring-2022_en.pdf)\n\nBut this also means that the war in Ukraine is not the main culprit of rising food prices - it has only accelerated what has already been brewing long before the first Russian soldier put his foot on Ukrainian land.\n\nWheat prices are yet to hit the market, and just with raw material price increase of 90% we can expect that some of the manufacturers will start having trouble delivering their product to European customers at the beginning of the next year. A partial collapse of production capabilities is plausible in Europe next year. One of the hardest-hit products are bread and cereals, with almost a 40% increase in price since September 2021, meat sits at 22%, and oils and fats almost at 50%.\n\nThis is a producer price index, so it tells us that f.e. it currently costs 40% more than September last year to produce bread and cereals. We, as consumers, have not felt much up to now, and we'll bear the brunt of these prices by the beginning of the next year.\n\nEurostat data (switch to PPI): [http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitViewTableAction.do](http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitViewTableAction.do)\n\nThe shortages are yet to come.\n\nTo sum-up: due to rising raw material/energy/fuel prices we may expect to see food getting even twice as expensive for us next year, and partial food production shutdowns in food processing plants across Europe as soon as next year.\n\n**EDIT:** u/Dave37 **asked for calculation methodology, I'm adding it below:**\n\nLet's take a look at the data here (reference point is August 2021, 11 months ago):\n\n1. Wheat price futures are 90% in the first quarter of 2022 (25% in 2021, respectively)\n2. European PPI is at 20% since August 2021 for food, 40% for bread/cereals\n3. Energy cost per MWh rose from 82 EUR to 177,51 EUR since August '21 (a 216% increase)\n\nAlso:\n\n1. 17% of total European energy goes into food industry (almost a fifth of total supply)\n2. We are now getting the last year's PPI as end consumers (CPI rose only by 10% since Aug '21 while PPI rose by 30% by Aug '21)\n3. Average PPI calculated for May 2022 has risen 20% on average across the food industry since Aug '21\n\nAccording to [this study](https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/energy_prices_and_costs_-_final_report_-_annexes_v12.3.pdf) by the European Commission, and [this study](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/41035/15330_aer780d_1_.pdf?v=0) by USDA, energy cost is responsible for 3.5% of food cost in retail, and ca. 20% of food production cost.\n\nSo, energy cost goes as follows:20\\*1,035 (food production cost multiplied by food retail cost) = 20,7% total energy for end customer.\n\nWe are now paying for products made last year. Which means next year we'll be paying 24,01% more for food just for the energy cost. (20,7\\*2,16=44,712; 44,712-20,7=24,01 is the percentage for next year).\n\nRaw material cost in food production accounts for [35-40% of the end customer price](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268791925_Share_of_raw_material_costs_in_total_production_costs).\n\nWe've taken wheat as an indicator with futures up by 90%. Assuming it's 35% of food production cost, 0,35\\*1,90=0,66 **factor of manufacturing cost.** This will have to be paid by the end customer next year instead of 0,35 now. If we take a shortcut and assume it as a percentage, we get another 31%.\n\nTransportation is the last factor taken into account. Most transportation is done with diesel cars. [This study](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/45165/41076_err160-summary.pdf?v=0) by USDA assumes a factor of one-fifth of diesel price-food price, in which a 100% increase in diesel price translates to 20-28% rise in food price. Diesel is more expensive by 149% on average now, which should translate to 29,8-41,72%. Assuming the most optimistic approach, we get another 29.8% added to the average price.\n\nSumming-up:Energy responsible for price hike of 20.7%Raw material responsible for 31% (simplified)Transportation responsible for 29,8%\n\n**TOTAL 81,5% in the most optimistic variant**"}
