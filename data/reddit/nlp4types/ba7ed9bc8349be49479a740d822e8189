[Its green forests, snowy peaks and pristine lakes](https://rafairusta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/galeria-picos-de-europa.jpg) attract an average of three million tourists a year, from all over the world. These tourists are however warned against venturing into the national park without proper guidance; the \"Picos\" are every bit as treacherous as they're beautiful. Deaths by misadventure at the park are not a strange occurrence; hikers that wander out of the safe paths and end up falling to their deaths and off-piste skiers swallowed by avalanches top the list of fatalities. Rain and snow storms can often happen with little warning, temperatures as low as -35 \u00baC (or -31 \u00baF) have been recorded during these blizzards. Many still unsolved missing people cases have taken place there, and in at least two separate instances SAR helicopters have crashed into the mountains while looking for them, killing their crews. And finally, there's the (less likely) risk of dangerous encounters with the local wildlife; most of Spain's confirmed bear attacks on humans have taken place at that area. Wolves and wild boars can pose a risk to humans at the park as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn summary, a visit or walk around this breathtaking national park is not without a series of fatal dangers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Eloy Campillo**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 1945, [Eloy Campillo P\u00e9rez](https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/dSLFH-t55CJb_YYp__mamWfKnl4=/414x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/NMQR2TFZZZCE5FHGHRNE4Y6EFA.jpg) was 31-years old. He was a park ranger at Picos de Europa. He was also the major of a small town named [Sotres](https://www.google.com/maps/place/33554+Sotres,+Asturias,+Espa%C3%B1a/@43.2326742,-4.7477525,547m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd49c807f699c411:0xcb93ca5863efedc3!8m2!3d43.2326044!4d-4.7468755), located just afoot of the northern Asturian side of the park. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEloy's circumstances had placed him in a really, really tough spot. Previously a monarchy, Spain [became a democratic republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Spanish_Republic) in 1931 after rebel forces deposed the wildly unpopular King Alfonso XIII (who had supported the conservative dictatorship of Army general [Primo de Rivera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Primo_de_Rivera) between 1923 and 1930). A new Constitution and parliament were installed instead, with socialists and progressive parties winning the first elections by a landslide. After five years in which social tensions between the left and the right wing rose to concerning levels, Spain held the General Elections of 1936, pitting the Popular Front (socialist, Marxist, progressive) against the National Front (conservative, monarchist, religious). While the parties were more evenly matched now, once again the left won as the Popular Front officially scored some 110,000 more votes than the National Front. Many prominent names among the conservatives started to plot a coup d'etat, and one of these was [Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Calvo_Sotelo), a conservative politician that had previously served in the dictatorial government of the aforementioned Primo de Rivera. His assassination in July 13th, 1936 sparked a three-year long, very bitter, brutal and bloody [civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War), at the end of which Army general [Francisco Franco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Franco) (who had the support of the European Axis powers) imposed a fascist-conservative dictatorship that lasted until his death in 1975. This state of affairs, added to the nation-wide famine that spanned through the 1940's (a consequence of the war) spurred [rebel guerrilla forces](https://static3.leonoticias.com/www/multimedia/201809/26/media/cortadas/maquisyminers-k2oH-U601040235013LVD-984x608@Leonoticias.jpg) that aimed at getting rid of the anti-democratic Francoist Regime that had just been imposed. These guerrilla fighters often hid in the wilderness, as the Civil Guard (supportive of Franco) was in the lookout for anyone who actively opposed the Regime.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Note; this explanation of the political circumstances of Spain at the time is extremely simplistic, and the reality was way more nuanced that I've just described here. Anyone who wishes to get a better grasp of it should take a look at the Wiki articles I've linked in this writeup.*   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the major of his hometown, Eloy's job was to ensure the town would function according to the existing laws. Which means he was required to inform Law Enforcement of any anti-Francoist activity he'd notice going on. On the other hand, his job as forest ranger often ensured he'd be in touch with many of these guerrilla rebels, and Eloy was cordial and sympathetic to many of them -many of which had been his childhood friends before the war. Reportedly, Eloy just wanted to be left out of politics, and he paid lip service to the Regime to avoid getting himself and his loved ones in trouble.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Eloy's disappearance**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEloy's burdens worsened in April of 1945, as the fall of Berlin at the hands of the Soviet Red Army became imminent. His friends among the exiled guerrilla forces became bolder than ever, thinking that they'd soon be able to restore the Republic with the help of the Soviet Union (along with Mexico, the only helping hand they got against Franco during the war). In spite of this, Eloy had agreed to a secretive picnic [at a rural house in the park](https://ibb.co/16mrswQ), with his guerrilla friends as well as some uninvolved friends and acquaintances. One of these guerrilla fighters was 27-years old [Juan \"Juan\u00edn\" Fern\u00e1ndez Ayala](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9FUOtA9PA84/WpyOY-Ka1EI/AAAAAAAApXU/C6Co5KAJtWQ2rPu2hwW4MmvqyB8rUEgFQCLcBGAs/s1600/juanin%2B%25281%2529.jpg), who had fought in the republican side during the war. The picnic took place on Sunday April 15th. Two days earlier, on  Friday 13th, Eloy had mentioned the picnic to one of his fellow park rangers, Alfonso Mart\u00ednez. Alfonso notified the [Civil Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Guard_(Spain)) about the picnic, and the officers organized a raid. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround noon of that Sunday several Civil Guard officers approached the rural house where the picnic was being set. Reportedly, Eloy was seen by the officers at the scene, unarmed. The guerrilla fighters initiated fire, and a shootout ensued. One guerrilla fighter and two Civil Guard officers were killed before the Civil Guard team, feeling outgunned, retreated back to the town for backups. By the time such backups reached to the scene the guerrilla had fleed to the mountains. Eloy was nowhere to be seen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJuan\u00edn and the guerrilla suspected (rightfully) that someone that knew of the picnic had snitched on them, which was confirmed when they found a letter in the pocket of one of the fallen officers. Such letter mentioned Alfonso's snitch, but also Eloy was referenced there. Because of this, on April 24th (nine days after the shootout) the guerrilla abducted several men at gunpoint and took them to a cave in the park for questioning. Eloy was among these taken hostage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter hours of questioning (and torture) all but two hostages were let go, already late into the night. One of these two remaining was Eloy. He, along with another man, were forced at gunpoint to march in the darkness deep into the park. Reportedly, they were finally executed by gunshots, and many guerrilla fighters that would later surrender in the following months would point at Juan\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez as the man that executed Eloy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonths later the relatives of both men would learn about their demise. The other man's body was quickly retrieved for burial. However, Eloy's body could not be located in spite of extensive searches by the Civil Guard and volunteers. And its whereabout would remain unknown for 73 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJuan\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez was never captured by the authorities, and remained an active guerrilla fighter for the rest of his life. [He was killed on April 24th, 1957](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Tumba_de_Juan%C3%ADn.jpg/1200px-Tumba_de_Juan%C3%ADn.jpg), precisely twelve years after Eloy's disappearance, during another shootout with the Civil Guard. Theoretically, only he knew where he presumably had executed Eloy and where his remains were. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The discovery of Eloy's remains**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the summer of 2018 a team of professional spelunkers made it into [a pit cave named Torca de Topinoria](https://www.google.com/maps/place/33554+Sotres,+Asturias,+Espa%C3%B1a/@43.2201762,-4.6859813,34m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0xd49c807f699c411:0xcb93ca5863efedc3!8m2!3d43.2326044!4d-4.7468755), on a hill in the eastern end of the Picos de Europa National Park. The entry is basically [a long but very narrow, easy to miss crack on the ground rock](https://img.europapress.es/fotoweb/fotonoticia_20190922164648_1200.jpg). In fact, it's considered a danger to hikers on winter because snow makes it even harder to spot until it's already too late.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis narrow crack is very deceiving. Soon into the descent, the cave leads to [a very wide main shaft](https://cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/HE4AFLMFZBD2XLILWABWTGUI4I.jpg), which descends [almost fully vertically for 180 meters (590 feet)](https://ibb.co/44ffr8L) down to a muddy bottom full of debris. This team of spelunkers had been exploring many pit caves in northern Spain, looking to find the whereabouts of people that had gone missing during the civil war and the Francoist Regime. Like Eloy's case, which in fact was one they already had included in the search plan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[After a careful inspection of the mud and debris at the bottom](https://ibb.co/R20nqYt), some human bones were found. Among these were part of a skull that had still retained pieces of its jawbone. Even though no teeth remained, some DNA could be extracted for analysis later on...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter 73 years, Eloy Campillo P\u00e9rez had finally been found.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe news were soon shared with Eloy's daughter Mercedes, who was only two years old when Eloy disappeared. Mercedes, aged 75 in 2018, [hiked all the way to the pit cave's entrance](https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/0CLZ0L-drt830gmKXyovuh2EQmE=/1960x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/JIJUM6T2LBA6FF22RHC7TSVJRY.jpg) later on during subsequent expeditions. She had been actively looking for her father's whereabouts since the 1960's. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurther searches on the cave later on retrieved more of Eloy's bones. His skull bones showed [evidence of a gunshot injury](https://ibb.co/hLCHkSQ), and [the shell of a 9mm-Largo](https://ibb.co/CWxV3tt) bullet fired by an [Astra 400 handgun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astra_400) was found nearby as well. Juan\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez himself owned a copy of such model, which is currently on display at the [Army Museum](https://ejercito.defensa.gob.es/museo/en/index.html?__locale=en) in Toledo. However, the museum's authorities didn't authorize a comparative analysis on the gun, fearing it could damage it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEloy's skeleton was reconstructed as further as possible during the summer, with [the spelunkers making several descents](https://ibb.co/x7zwVNJ) and searches to look for the rest of his scattered remains. The case of Eloy Campillo was now a closed case, even if it couldn't be proved if it was indeed Juan\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez who killed him. However, this closure made room to a new, baffling mystery;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[There were other bones that clearly couldn't belong to Eloy](https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/X6yqX-SPg_N-YsApxBGBSgA2H1Q=/1960x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/QWX5ZSFY65DPNK2ACGPYTTU2QA.jpg) because of their morphology and, more importantly, because many of these would have no place on Eloy's skeleton. Who was this other person? Was another victim executed along with Eloy that night of April 24th, 1945? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The unidentified girl**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe spelunkers worked now on the retrieval of two different people. Little by little, more of this person's bones popped out during the search.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Another jaw bone was found, which had still retained some teeth](https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/AiFsc7i8vsg-sTPYtWHJj_dBHk0=/1960x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/7PGOZFMFTVHF7EFXQR4N4FBOCM.jpg) where DNA could be sampled from. Soon it was determined that the bones belonged to a female individual. Further analysis of her key bones (like her femur) yielded more exhaustive data; she was very young, with her age at the time of her death estimated to be 10 to 14-years old.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow did this girl end up here? Did she spend her last minutes of life next to Eloy's still warm corpse? Turned out, she couldn't possibly have; analyses done by [ICA Inc. in Sunrise, Florida (United States)](https://www.radiocdating.com/) \\-where one of her teeth had been sent to- in December of 2019 showed that this girl died at some point between 1950 and 1960. Which means that by the time she ended up at the bottom of the pit cave Eloy had been dead for five year at the least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first conjecture about her identity created a very logical and plausible scenario; this girl could possibly have been a young shepherd, or just the child of a family of local shepherds (at the time a plentiful demographic in the area). Given the treacherous morphology of the cave's entrance, she may have accidentally fallen while walking or running around. Maybe it could even happened one winter when the snow had concealed the crack even further, as mentioned earlier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, the analyses performed by accomplished forensic anthropology doctor [Fernando Serrulla](https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/3V7wOPx3O_0jM7k7hA0zrhph6ME=/1960x1103/arc-anglerfish-eu-central-1-prod-prisa.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KH6QJEE6HDGMHNOBAHI34FBTOY.jpg) (who had managed to give the names back to 88 unidentified fallen soldiers of the Falklands War and has been asked to help in the case) soon casted a doubt about this potential scenario. For starters, the content of stable isotopes in the bones found did not support the idea that she could have been a rural shepherd. [The high amount of \u03b413C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9413C) in her remains pointed at a diet very rich in either corn or seafood protein. But given the fact that [relatively high levels of \u03b415N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9415N) were found as well (indicating a diet rich in animal protein), the corn diet angle became less likely. According to Dr. Serrulla, this girl likely grew up on a coastal region, and her diet was heavily based on fish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpeaking of her diet, it was less than adequate. One of the first bones found was her right femur, and from the get go Serrulla and his team observed signs of femoral and cranial [porotic hyperostosis (\"spongy bones\")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porotic_hyperostosis), a condition that is a consequence of chronic malnutrition during childhood. This piece of information wouldn't be of much use to single out any Spanish demographic in particular; given the intervals for the time of her dead and her age, it means that she was born at some point between 1936 and 1950. As mentioned earlier, [Spain had gone through a period of famine in the aftermath of the Civil War](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022009419876004), being at its harshest during the early 1940's but lasting until well into the 1950's. Pretty much only the ruling class and the wealthy could secure means to maintain proper nutrition. The majority of Spanish people, on the other hand, lived in a constant state of food insecurity. Therefore, the girl found at the Topinoria pit cave could belong to virtually any working class family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer DNA was further analyzed in order to create a description of what she could have looked like. As said earlier, she was a prepubescent girl whose age at the time of death sat somewhere between 10 to 14 years. Her most probable height was 141 to 142 cm (or about 4ft8), although she could have been also as short as 136 cm or as tall as 147 cm (4ft6 and 4ft10, respectively). She was of European ancestry, although there isn't more precise data about this point. She was probably fair-skinned, and her eye color was likely either green or honey-like. Her most probable hair color was a dark shade of brown.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLocals were questioned about a girl with these characteristics that may have gone missing; the elderly was asked, and so were people whose ancestors had lived there and could possibly have mentioned it to their children and grandchildren. This endeavor was ultimately in vain; there seemed to be no local recollection of a girl of these characteristics going missing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe closest the investigators got to a possible lead was a little historical fact about the area; back in the Francoist times there were records of small settlements of outsiders, away from the towns. These outsiders came from many other parts of Spain, looking for better opportunities in the northern part of the country (where the mining industry has traditionally provided a living thousands of families). These people built their own sheds and sacks on the hills afoot of the national park. It was learned during the investigation that one of these settlements had been located not far from the Topinoria pit cave. Therefore, it's believed that this girl may have belonged to a family of settlers, and the authorities never learned about her life nor death. This is currently considered to be the most plausible explanation on her origins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer DNA profile was uploaded to the [F\u00e9nix Database](https://elpais.com/diario/1999/05/22/sociedad/927324014_850215.html), a project launched in 1999 by the Civil Guard to help and solve cold cases, as well to identify long unclaimed bodies. However, *F\u00e9nix* had nothing to show to the investigators about the Topinoria girl. No one related to her is in there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTaking this angle a step further, her DNA was sent internationally to be pitted in other DNA databases, one of these samples being sent to the United States to be compared in the [FBI's CODIS](https://www.fbi.gov/services/laboratory/biometric-analysis/codis/codis-and-ndis-fact-sheet). And yet again, zero results yielded; her relatives aren't there either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Since only 18% of the girl's skeleton has been retrieved](https://ibb.co/wWmFHvM) (in contrast with 90% of Eloy's) it has not been possible to determine the exact cause of death. The analyses on this aspect have yielded strange results; even though she likely fell down the cave's 180m (590 ft) main shaft, most of her remains found did not show sings of high-energy impact -for example, the bones of Eloy's right leg, his jawbone, pelvis and many ribs were shattered, most likely by the impact against the cave's bottom. In fact, [her femurs were intact](https://ibb.co/5hTNpfX), and so was her jaw. The only bone fractures found so far are restricted to her cranial bones. The head injury was determined to have happened perimortem (at ot around time of death). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are two main scenarios being considered about her death; accidental (she accidentally fell down the pit cave and died on impact with the bottom) or criminal (she was murdered by blunt force trauma to the head and her killer ditched her body down the pit cave). Given the small amount of bones retrieved so far, investigators are not favoring one scenario over another.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for June of 2022, the identity of the Topinoria girl remains a mystery. While the investigation is still ongoing, there are no significant DNA leads to date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Eloy Campillo's remains were eventually given to his family](https://ibb.co/4KJMg35), so he could have a burial. He is buried at the cemetery of Sotres, the same town he was the major of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMercedes Campillo has allowed the Topinoria girl to be buried at that same cemetery as well, right next to her father's grave. *\"After they've been so many years together down in the cave, it wouldn't be fair to part them now\"*, she told the investigators.     \n\n\n  \n\n\n**Sources**  \n\n\n*English*  \n[Digis Mak - Who's the girl who died 60 years ago found in a 180-meter chasm?](https://digismak.com/who-is-the-girl-who-died-60-years-ago-found-in-a-180-meter-chasm-science/)  \n\n\n*Spanish*  \n[La recuperaci\u00f3n e identificaci\u00f3n de los restos de Eloy Campillo](https://cpage.mpr.gob.es/producto/la-recuperacion-e-identificacion-de-los-restos-de-eloy-campillo-2/) \\- A 108-pages long online book produced by the authorities that took the case.
