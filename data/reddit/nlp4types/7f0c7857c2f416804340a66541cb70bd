In Q2 the economy +13%. Is this a record growth?   \n\n**Kerobyan:** Yes. Based on the Q2 data from 100 countries, Armenia is...\n\n**Reporter:** Don't say #1...\n\n**Kerobyan:** #1. Then came Colombia and Saudi Arabia. In July the economy +19.4%, and in January-July +13.1%. \n\n**Reporter:** What is driving this?\n\n**Kerobyan:** First of all, we cannot ignore the favorable geopolitical factors, but let's not forget that in January-February, before the war in Ukraine, the growth was 12%. Our efforts to improve the business climate have played a significant role. \n\nIn construction, we have a very serious growth, and it came after 1.5 years of systemic efforts to reform the construction legislation.\n\n**Reporter:** But many construction firms complain today. \n\n**Kerobyan:** They want it even better, but it has significantly improved if you compare it to what we had 2 years ago. The processes are faster, more transparent, and digitized. This is helping to grow the sector. \n\n**Reporter:** Exports +82% in July, and +40% in January-July. How is this possible if the dollar has dropped and our products became more expensive? Combined with logistics issues, wasn't this suppose to hurt our exports? Maybe we should just strengthen dram?\n\n**Kerobyan:** Good question. The issue is not only in the exchange rate, but more importantly in economic productivity. You know that we have launched reforms to drastically raise our economy's productivity. \n\nThe average Armenian worker produces $6.8/hr, which is 7x lower than in Europe. To address this, we have launched 3 programs:\n\n1) State subsidies for companies to purchase equipment to modernize their production. We have already launched it and it's doing great. Many industries are taking advantage of it. \n\n2) The government [has a new program](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/wh55ub/friday_news_summary_from_armenia_aug52022/) to pay Armenian companies to hire highly skilled workers with foreign experience or degrees from the world's top universities.\n\n**Reporter:** But that package hasn't gone into effect yet. How do you explain the July growth? \n\n**Kerobyan:** That's for the future, but the increase in productivity and changes in the labor market is already visible. We will have better data at the end of this year, but today we already see that companies are taking steps to raise productivity or reduce costs.\n\nThere is also a vacuum of certain product categories in the Russian market. Our companies are taking advantage of this. Textile +200%, beverages and food sector is also up, and high-tech exports are up. But most importantly, the share of mineral exports has reduced from 60% to 30%. We are developing certain branches of the processing industry, such as diamond making, jewelry, chemistry, pharma, solar production, etc. \n\nWe want to provide subsidies to our IT sector to alleviate the negative effects of dram's appreciation. Here is a little secret: the state subsidy program for modern machinery will allow companies to borrow in dram and convert it to a dollar for the purchase. This should help strengthen the dollar a bit. I believe it's harmful if the dollar is below 450. Today it's 400. \n\n**Reporter:** Services +27%. Critics say it's not because of your efforts, but because of Russian arrivals. \n\n**Kerobyan:** And why do you think Russians chose Armenia?\n\n**Reporter:** They didn't have many options?\n\n**Kerobyan:** Wrong. Thanks to the post-2018 democratic reforms, we created a more open business environment in Armenia, allowing creative people to feel comfortable in Armenia. It is because of these reforms that many Russians chose Armenia for their long-term activities. We see that the majority of them have not been disappointed. \n\nOur immediate efforts to attract and help them adapt in Armenia have also played a major role. Russians have formed 300 large companies and 2,500 small ones, along with their employees and turnover all registered in Armenia.  \n\nAnd if we're talking about services, let's not forget about tourism as well. In July, tourism finally almost reached the 2019 level. Here is another little secret: all hotels were fully booked in several cities in July. \n\nWith the help of the Foreign Ministry and NSS, we have simplified the visa regime for 50 countries. We saw an immediate result. There is a great demand in the hotel industry. \n \n**Reporter:** Former deputy PM Vache Gabrielyan [2014-2018] predicts that Russians will quickly leave and take their money with them, causing serious challenges for our economy.  \n\n**Kerobyan:** Love the dude, awesome economist, but his predictions are always wrong. I remember in early 2021, while I was discussing the high economic growth, he claimed that Armenia's economy had no potential. I agree with him that we need to grow the potential, but since I myself was a businessman before becoming a minister, I see the pathways to raise the potential and productivity in a short period. \n\nIn as little as 1-3 months, we can raise many companies' productivity by 50%-100%, simply by improving certain procedures. Investments can raise their productivity even more.     \n\n**Reporter:** So you don't believe there will be a sudden exodus of Russians once the war is over? \n\n**Kerobyan:** I don't. Russian economists were recently discussing various economic growth scenarios in Russia for the next 10-15 years. None of them fare well under the sanctions, but I don't want to discuss that because we are taking steps to develop our own economy, to have the environment for Indians, Russians, and others to find the conditions they need to create and thrive in Armenia.\n\n**Reporter:** Got anything else to add?\n\n**Kerobyan:** Surmalu blast should be a wake-up call. It's time for Armenians to take the rules and safety more seriously. It is difficult to grow the economy in a country where the society is not growing. \n\n**Reporter:** But the January-July statistics are proof that we can remain \u0562\u0561\u057c\u0561\u0564\u0561\u0580\u056b and still have nice economic growth.\n\n**Kerobyan:** Nevertheless, we need to improve ourselves. \n\n**Reporter:** You got trashed for the decision not to provide material assistance to businesses that lost property during the blast.   \n\n**Kerobyan:** We provide aid to individuals who got hurt, but for businesses it's different. They need to purchase insurance.\n\n**Reporter:** Not everyone can afford it. \n\n**Kerobyan:** The ones in Surmalu could.\n\n[watch,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvlcHxg4d1M) #Economy \n\n\n\n##Armenian farmers are replacing tractors with drones to spray crops with pesticide | VIDEO \n\nThe trees are planted densely, so farmer Gagik can't use heavy equipment like a tractor without damaging them. A better solution is a drone with a video feed. \n\nHe hired a drone company for \u058f20,000/ha. That's more expensive than hiring a tractor, but he found that drones are more efficient and in the end, it costs the same. Drones are also able to more evenly distribute the liquid. The drone requires 20x less water than the tractor, said the drone company.\n\nThe drone company launched its operations 3 years ago. More and more farmers are hiring them today. It takes one farmer from a village to hire them, the rest feel \u057b\u056b\u057b\u056b\u056c. The company has so far sprayed 2,000 hectares this year.  \n\nAnother advantage of a drone is that it doesn't mess with the bees. Tractors had to be used before dawn in order not to harm the hives. \n\n[watch,](https://youtu.be/oxuN44wtY48)\n[read,](https://www.1lurer.am/hy/2022/08/31/%D4%B4%D6%80%D5%B8%D5%B6%D5%A8%D5%9D-%D5%A1%D5%B5%D5%A3%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%B4-%D5%A1%D5%B6%D6%85%D5%A4%D5%A1%D5%B9%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%B6%D5%A5%D6%80%D5%A8-%D5%A3%D5%B5%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%B2%D5%BF%D5%A1%D6%80%D5%A1%D5%AE%D6%84%D5%B6%D5%A5%D6%80-%D5%A5%D5%B6-%D5%BD%D6%80%D5%BD%D5%AF%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%B4/786104)\n\n\n\n##Iran is lifting certain import restrictions \n\nIranian businesses got the green light to use crypto for imports in a bid to bolster trade in the country.
