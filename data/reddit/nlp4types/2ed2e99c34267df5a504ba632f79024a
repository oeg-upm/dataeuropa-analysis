Perhaps one of the most ambitious Bills of the term so far aside from the Sanctions Bill, I do appreciate that this may be longer than most others, so I would like to first give an overview of what each Part of this Bill does.\n\n* **Part 1**: Sets out a set of requirements for \u201cPersonally Repairable Goods\u201d, namely that they must either be repairable by someone who knows how to and has the right tools and parts at home, or that the manufacturer offers a repair service. Manufacturers also have to provide schematics, where designs aren\u2019t self-explanatory.\n* **Part 2**: Sets out a set of requirements for \u201cBusiness Repairable Goods\u201d, very similar to those for Personally Repairable Goods except referring to the tools, parts and knowledge that someone running a business specialising in the good\u2019s repair would have. \n* **Part 3**: This part outlaws the practices of planned obsolescence, deliberately causing a product to break after a certain time or number of uses, and the related contrived durability, deliberately causing a product to degrade or reduce in effectiveness at an increased rate, but without precise knowledge of when.\n* **Part 4**: Part 4 sets out several reporting requirements for manufacturers of any product, namely that the predicted lifespan must be prominently displayed before purchase and methodology must be available on demand, and that an accurate list of the parts and equipment needed to repair a product must be available on request. It also lets the relevant Secretary add extra reporting restrictions by regulation, but these can be annulled by the Commons.\n* **Part 5**: Provides penalties and creates offences for breaching the other Parts of the Act; makes officers of the body corporate who are aware of such offences also liable, albeit as natural persons; instructs the market surveillance authority to test that products are repairable and that the reports under Part 4 are accurate, and to provide law enforcement with the appropriate test data if it fails testing; and contains the standard \u201cCommencement, Extent and Short Title\u201d Section.\n* **Schedules 1 &amp; 2** Contain lists of Personally Repairable Goods and Business Repairable Goods respectively. These may be amended by Order in Council, subject to a confirmatory vote by the Commons unless they consist only of adding items to the lists. (M: These lists draw on several IRL regulations, listed in the credits above, as well as my own judgments.)\n\nI hope the Members of this House find this satisfactory - and if not I welcome them to propose amendments, especially in expanding the Schedules.\n\nBut why is the Right to Repair so important? In 2021 alone, [there were 57 megatonnes of e-waste generated globally, less than 20% of which was recycled](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-61350996). Meanwhile, poisonous chemicals leach into the environment through landfills and the global supply of rare earth metals becomes ever-more concentrated into countries with dodgy human rights records and less stringent workers\u2019 rights and protection than ours. The problem is, of course, that manufacturers deliberately reduce devices\u2019 lifespans and then prevent users from repairing them when they inevitably do break.\n\nThe root cause of this is the profit incentives. If products break quicker and consumers are unable to repair them they are forced to buy a replacement, usually from the same company. This of course drives up demand and prices, increasing income and profits. In terms of money, it\u2019s a no-brainer: the company gets to line its pockets, while the consumer gets the latest and greatest devices.\n\nBut this has massive consequences both for people and for the environment. Not only does e-waste have a horrible impact directly on the environment as mentioned above, it also has massive effects in terms of the energy and transport required to dispose of old devices and manufacture new ones. The extraction of the raw materials required, too, has a negative impact - metals like tantalum, gold, rare earth metals, and especially lithium tend to be water- and energy-intensive to mine, and release pollutants into the atmosphere and local water supplies. [Although beautiful](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25333710-200-lithium-fields-beautiful-from-the-air-trouble-on-the-ground/), lithium mines in Argentina, Chile and Bolivia have raised fears over water shortages, taking away from indigenous communities\u2019 historic water supplies.\n\nThe social effects are also massive. One of the UK\u2019s best authors in my opinion, Sir Terry Pratchett, summed up the phenomenon best in character Sam Vimes\u2019s [socioeconomic theory of boots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_theory):\n\n&gt; A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, \u2026 cost about ten dollars \u2026 But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time \u2026 This was the Captain Samuel Vimes \"Boots\" theory of socioeconomic unfairness.\n\nThe analogy here is of course that people who have to buy devices frequently because they break have to spend much more in the long run that if they could buy similar devices that could operate for a longer period of time end up having to pay much more in the long run, reducing the amount of disposable income that can be spend on other things. For the very poorest, this means the choice between feeding themselves and being able to access services almost necessary for modern life like the internet or the cellular network. If these devices were repairable cheaply and easily, the vast majority simply would not have to put up with this problem. \n\nSpeaker, closely linked to an inability to repair products is the practice of planned obsolescence, and its related practice of contrived durability. Before I proceed I believe it would be instructive to educate the House as to the difference, especially as I was not aware of the difference before doing my research for this Bill. Planned obsolescence is building into a device or product a specific date or number of uses after which a product will stop working or decrease predictably in effectiveness. Crucially, planned obsolescence is exactly that - planned; the manufacturer controls when it occurs. Contrived durability, on the other hand, isn\u2019t controlled; the manufacturer makes the product degrade quicker that it needs to or otherwise would, but does not control the rate at which it occurs or the specific time.\n\nThis Bill outlaws both in Part 3. Both are despicable practices that encourage the type of environmental carelessness and disdain for the masses outlined earlier. But it is important to note the rationale companies provide for these - it is once again motivated by profit. This is why it\u2019s so crucial to remove the profit incentives here; unlike some previous Bills this term, the offences created here ensure that crime is not profitable - ten counts of breach of the right to repair could result in a minimum fine of a year\u2019s income (not profit!) of said corporation, as well as half of a year\u2019s income of any officer of the body with whose connivance the offence occurred.\n\nThe final main effect of this Bill is the reporting requirements. Currently, there are two but these may in the future be expanded by regulation from the relevant Secretary. These are that all manufacturers must make public the expected lifespan of a product, and that they must, if covered by the right to repair, make public the parts and equipment required to repair the product. These are all common sense - how can the right to repair be obeyed when people do not know how to repair the product?\n\nThere are also various consequential administrative tasks that this Bill does, most notably instructing the market surveillance authority to perform testing on products to ensure they meet the standards laid out by the Bill. This is a crucial step to be able to detect when companies and individuals have breached parts the right to repair or the ban on planned obsolescence or contrived durability. The market surveillance authority is to hand over data from tests on any failing products to the relevant law enforcement agency, so this provides an effective way of identifying and throwing the book at companies who try to cut corners to drive up profits illegally.\n\nSpeaker, I hope this House is able to pass this Bill. It would herald a new era for those who normally struggle to afford to to replace broken devices. They could, to again borrow the analogy, buy a really good pair of boots - because every pair of boots would be good-quality. Every pair of boots would last for years and years, and no one would have to put up with wet feet or boots that leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out. With a simple trip to the cobblers, you could assure yourself that your boots worked as well as when they were bought. What a world that would be.\n\nI commend this Bill to the House.\n\n---\n\nThis reading will end on Wednesday 13th July at 10PM BST"}
