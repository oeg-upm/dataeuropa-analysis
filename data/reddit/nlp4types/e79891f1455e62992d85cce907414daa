WHO REVIEW OF STUDIES ON FACE MASKS (2019)**\n\n**In September 2019, just before the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a comprehensive report on \"Non-pharmaceutical public health measures to mitigate the risk and impact of the epidemic and influenza pandemic\"** . The report examined ten randomized controlled trials concerning the efficacy of face masks against flu-like illness (III). As the table below shows, **none of the studies found a statistically significant benefit of face masks**.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE INFECTIONS OF INDIVIDUAL STATES, AFTER MANDATES FOR THE USE OF THE MASK**\n\n**In many states, coronavirus infections have risen sharply since the introduction of the obligation to wear masks**.

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PRESCRIPTION OF THE N95 / FFP2 MASK**\n\nIn January 2021, the Land of Bavaria was one of the first places in the world to impose N95 / Ffp2 masks in most public settings. A comparison with other German L\u00e4nder, which required medical fabrics or masks, indicates that **the N95 / Ffp2 masks also made no difference**.\n\nIn January 2021, Austria was the first country in the world to introduce the prescription of the N95 / Ffp2 mask nationwide. Obligation further expanded in September 2021. However, Austria had the highest infection rate in the world in November 2021.\n\n(you can look at the graphs on the article's page)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**E.

However, due to their large pore size and poor fit, most face masks cannot filter out aerosols - **over 90% of aerosols penetrate or bypass the mask and fill a medium-sized room in minutes**\\--&gt;([https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577))\n\n**2) WHO admitted to the BBC that its June 2020 mask policy update was not due to new evidence but to \"political lobbying\"**: \"We were told by various sources that the WHO committee examining the evidence did not support the masks but had recommended them due to political pressure.

In fact, the flu has also disappeared in states without masks, lockdowns and school closures (eg Sweden and Florida).\n\n**8)** The initially low coronavirus infection rate in some Asian countries was not due to the masks, but to very rapid border checks. For example, Japan, despite its widespread use of face masks, had experienced its most recent flu outbreak ([https://www.upi.com/Top\\_News/World-News/2019/02/01/Millions-in-Japan-affected-as-flu-outbreak-grips-country/9191549043797/](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/02/01/Millions-in-Japan-affected-as-flu-outbreak-grips-country/9191549043797/)) just a year before the Covid pandemic.\n\n\\*\\*9)\\*\\*At the start of the pandemic, the \"Mask for All\" lobbies argued that the Czech Republic had few infections thanks to the early use of masks ([https://nitter.net/TedPetrou/status/1357382055441674241](https://nitter.net/TedPetrou/status/1357382055441674241)).\n\n**In reality, the pandemic had simply not yet reached Eastern Europe; a few months later, the Czech Republic had one of the highest infection rates in the world.**\n\n**10)** During the infamous 1918 flu pandemic, the use of masks among the general population was widespread and mandatory in some places, **but they made no difference** ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/04/02/everyone-wore-masks-during-1918-flu-pandemic-they-were-useless/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/04/02/everyone-wore-masks-during-1918-flu-pandemic-they-were-useless/))\n\n**F**. **THE PROBLEM OF AEREOSOL IN THE FACE MASK**\n\nIn the following video, the problem of aerosol in the face mask is explained.

STUDIES CLAIMING FACE MASKS ARE EFFECTIVE**\n\nSome recent studies have claimed that face masks are actually effective against the new coronavirus and could at least prevent other people's infection. However, **most of these studies suffer from poor methodology and sometimes show the opposite of what they claim to show**. Typically, these studies ignore the effect of other measures, the natural development of infection rates, changes in test activity or compare locations with different epidemiological conditions. Studies performed in labor\n\n## \n\n**AN OVERVIEW**\n\n**1)** A meta-study in the journal Lancet ([https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext)), commissioned by WHO, stated that masks could reduce the risk of infection by 80%, **but the studies mainly considered N95 respirators in a hospital setting, not cloth masks in a community setting, such evidence was reported as \"low\" and experts found numerous flaws in the study**.

But with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and mounting political pressure, studies have suddenly appeared claiming otherwise. In reality, these studies were a mixture of confusing observational data, unrealistic models and results obtained in the laboratory and not in real-life community situations.\n\nWe know how various political / media factors have contributed to the implementation of the prescription of masks: some politicians simply wanted to \"do something\" against the pandemic; others thought that face masks could have a \"psychological effect\" and could \"remind\" citizens to remain cautious (if anything, they had the opposite effect: create a \"false sense of security\" as happened with the greenpass in our country) ; still others have used mask prescriptions to enforce compliance and put pressure on the population to accept mass vaccination.\n\nIf the coronavirus is mainly transmitted via indoor aerosols, face masks are unlikely to be protective. They are just a tool of social control. A bit like the Islamic veil, which very often is a sign of submission of women. Here at least there is no sex discrimination."}
