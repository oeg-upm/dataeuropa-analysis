Was excited about my first hostel experience but am now waffling between whether or not I should pivot away from hostels/dorms to a private stay at a hotel. I found a decent place with a private room/bath in Prague for a comparable price and location, so at this point I have to make a judgement call based on personal comfort, risk tolerance, and available data. I'm curious what others have to say on the subject of monkeypox risk in hostels, especially in Prague / the EU; will share some observations and considerations of my own.\n\nCaveat: I'm not a virologist or health professional; doing the best I can with recommendations available from the US's Center for Disease Control (CDC) and various regional public health entities. I also understand that people responding to this post are not necessarily public health experts, so will be taking responses with a grain of salt just as others should take my own ;)\n\nFirst off, I'll acknowledge that I'm aware that a majority of reported monkeypox infections are for men who have sex with men. I will not be engaging in sexual conduct during my stay, and while I understand this reduces the risk of transmission I feel I cannot fully write off the risk of contracting monkeypox in a hostel situation given the various possible modes of transmission. In particular, I'm concerned about transmission risk from contact with lesions or body fluids in communal spaces, especially via linens/surfaces in dorms and shared bathrooms, and to a lesser extent the potential for respiratory transmission overnight while sleeping in a shared space; note that I'm basing these concerns off the [congregate living settings guidance from the US CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/specific-settings/congregate.html). \n\nWhile Czechia has a relatively low total case count (25 total reported as of August 4th per [this source](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/monkeypox-outbreak)), I'm still inclined towards caution since case rates in other nations are significantly higher (this includes several western EU nations and especially own country) and many of the people circulating through hostels will be non-Czechia citizens, likely from some of these high case rate nations. I plan to reach out to the hostels where I'm staying to inquire into their monkeypox policy and factor their responses into my decision, but in the meantime I'd be happy to hear others' anecdotes and considerations regarding monkeypox during their international travels, especially from EU/hostel settings."}
