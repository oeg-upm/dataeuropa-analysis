Utilising common words and phrases cobbled from the four nations of Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland, Scandinavian is a relatively easier to learn amalgamation of the group, which has often found praise from emigres and interstate travellers for being far more compatible than the regular linguistic complexities associated with Norwegian, Danish, Swedish and Finnish.\n\nThe Norwegian Prime Minister, Gro Brundtland, has travelled across to the capitals of **Denmark**, **Finland** and **Sweden** to deliver a transitional educational reform package to be introduced alongside the induction of Scandinavian. The new model, while not actively transformative of the core values of Nordic academia, standardizes the education every Scandinavian citizen is obligated to receive.\n\nA characteristic feature of Scandinavia is the significantly [high degree of public interest](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2019/09/24/the-3-secrets-to-scandinavian-innovation-in-education/) in children receiving a quality education. According to the [International Index of Human Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index), children across the country generally begin their education between the ages of 6 to 7. Similarly, the average number of years spent studying is from 10.3 years in Finland, up to 12.6 years in Norway.\n\nHowever, the expected study duration - the predicted model of time to be spent in study - is nearly [16 years in Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index). While this is proportionally predicted due to the [academic reconfiguration of Stockholm](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/whn16k/expansion_the_shining_cities_12/), this raw data is indicative that a significant population majority group within Scandinavia are students. In Europe, the average proportion of students and the rest of the population is [20-24%](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Educational_attainment_statistics#:~:text=In%202021%2C%2023.6%20%25%20of%20people,attainment%20level%20i.e.%20tertiary%20education). In Scandinavia, the share of students within the total population is 24.6% and rising. Even so, it remains to be noted that only 75% of students in Nordic countries receive a certificate of completion of the pre-university program, according to which they have the right to continue their studies at the university level.\n\nSuch circumstances are fairly understandable - By the age of eighteen, the average Scandinavian student often replaces higher education priorities with getting a job and moving out of home. But even in consideration to this, the average number of Scandinavian countries wishing to obtain higher education has escalated dramatically in the last two decades.\n\nThe education system of the Scandinavian countries will be rebuilt on one standardised model. The majority of Nordic academic institutions are public, and many private schools and universities already receive government subsidies. Thus, education in college or university in Scandinavia is free for students, with the exception of foreigners, who can receive merit-based free study scholarships or otherwise claim an encompassing loan. The pre-university program for students in the Scandinavian countries [lasts three years](https://www.dailyscandinavian.com/an-introduction-to-studying-in-scandinavia/), unlike most countries around the word, where children in high school study for two years. Subjects will be taught in a combination of Scandinavian and English, allowing for early connection to the rest of the Western world.\n\nThe main principle enshrined in the education system of Scandinavia is the availability of education to all, regardless of social origin, ethnicity or nationality, religious beliefs, or disabilities. Scandinavia is multicultural - Not just Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish, but Russian, Dutch, Estonian, and many more cultures.\n\nIntegrating our learning ensures the realization of the right of every member of society to the key pillars of Scandinavian unity, of which one of the most important is the right to equal access to education, profession, and determination of place in society. \n\nAnother characteristic feature of the developing educational system of Scandinavia is the promotion of **[lifelong learning](https://www.voced.edu.au/content/ngv%3A62024)**. Lifelong learning involves the organization and restructuring of education, beginning from early childhood and continuing to old age. Such education utilises the foundation of a division of education, at the level of parts and its alternation with employment throughout life.\n\nPart of this philosophy revolves around how education is not so much about knowledge, as much as what kind of society a person wants to and will live in, and what the school should give for happiness in this model. We abandon the word \u201csuccessful\u201d in the new Scandinavian language in the system of economic relations. Schools instead realise and cater to social demand: to raise a child in the value paradigm in which our society is built upon.\n\nFor Scandinavia, school is a reflection of society\u2019s values. It makes no sense to consider a school in any country, in any system, separately from the model of the state and society. The emigration to a value-oriented framework over the new educational reform is paramount."}
