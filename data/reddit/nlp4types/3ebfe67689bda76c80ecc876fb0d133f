As this sometimes happens shortly before or on arrival, it's difficult to refuse and discuss the necessity of these with the hotel or owner of course.\n\nThey almost often point toward 'the French law' that (according to them) states such a requirement. 'The French law' is of course very general and doesn't tell you anything and it's impossible to check whether they are correct.\n\nThe weird thing is though, that **most** hotel or holiday homes **don't** ask for it. Only **some** ask for it. Sometimes they only ask your date of birth, sometimes they want a passport number and sometimes they want a photocopy of your passport. I highly doubt the French law requires these items sometimes, but not always.\n\n^(For comparison: article 438 of the Dutch Penal Code requires those who professionally offer a nightly stay like a hotel to check the ID of a guest and subsequent write down the name, place of residence and arrival date of the primary guest. Spouses and children are excluded and it does not require the photocopy of an ID, only checking it. Source: see reference 1 at the bottom.)\n\nMy questions:\n\nA) Does anybody know whether a civil, penal and/or administrative law exist in France that requires hotels or holiday home owners to register their guests?\n\nB) If so, could you point toward a source for me to cross check so I can point toward it in case of an argument with the hotel or holiday home owner?\n\nC) Does the French data protection authority (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s, CNIL) approve of hotels or holiday homes to make photocopies of passports or other ID documents or approve of passport information being processed by hotels or holiday home?\n\nFor background: I know point 1 introduction and under (c) in article 6 of the GDPR (UE r\u00e8glement 2016/679) can justify the processing of personal information if a law exists and requires the processing of that information. On the other hand, recent answers to preliminary questions in case C\u2011184/20 (ECLI:EU:C:2022:601) of the European Court of Justice (2) make clear that member states cannot simply create a law so those who are subject to that law can start registering personal information like the photocopy of a passport. The purpose of such laws still need to be proportional to the goal that the processing of information tries to achieve. To be clear: that European court case concerned a completely different topic, but the Court does make clear that what is required 'by law' can still be in conflict with the GDPR depending on the circumstances.\n\n(1) [Article 438](http://wetten.overheid.nl/jci1.3:c:BWBR0001854&amp;boek=Derde&amp;titeldeel=II&amp;artikel=438) of the Dutch Penal Code  \n(2) [C-184/20, ECLI:EU:C:2022:601](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-184/20)"}
