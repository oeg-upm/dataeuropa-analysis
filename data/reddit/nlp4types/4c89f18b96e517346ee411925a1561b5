As cars get more advanced, we have the capacity to include more features in cars that would have been difficult to implement ten or twenty years ago.\n\nToday, the United Kingdom will follow our European counterparts in requiring advanced vehicle systems to be installed in new vehicles. Those advanced vehicle systems are, to quote from the EU Regulation:\n\t\n* intelligent speed assistance;\n* alcohol interlock installation facilitation;\n* driver drowsiness and attention warning;\n* advanced driver distraction warning;\n* emergency stop signal;\n* reversing detection; and\n* event data recorder.\n\nWhile some of these can be disabled, it is still the case that the addition of these features will make cars safer to drive and reduce fatalities and injuries that occur on British roads. This is a goal that the Department for Transport has been working towards for some time and it is in furtherance of that goal that we make these Regulations today.\n\nI am grateful to my right honourable friend the [Minister of State for Broadcasting](/u/eloiseaa728) for suggesting these Regulations be made.\n\nI do not anticipate the implementation of these Regulations to be much of a challenge, given that the EU already requires these features as of just a few weeks ago. We are giving automobile manufacturers three years to essentially duplicate what was already in the pipeline for the EU market. While this span of time may be more than is necessary, we want to ensure all manufacturers have enough time to implement these changes.\n\nI will make one final note on the nature of these Regulations. They enforce an EU Regulation. However, we are not adopting a new EU Regulation. That Regulation was made before the UK exited the European Union. Accordingly, it is retained legislation. While we are not bound to follow it, we can enforce its standards in domestic law.\n\nThank you, Mr Speaker, I commend these Regulations to the House.\n\n---\n\nDebate under this Statutory Instrument ends on Wednesday 27th July at 10PM BST"}
