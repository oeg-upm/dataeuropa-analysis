This represents a 14-month \"normal period\" before the pandemic, 10-month pre-vaccination, dual-wave \"pandemic period,\" and six months of vaccination.\n\nThe breakdown shows how cardiac arrest (CA) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) calls, confirmed on site by first responders, \"change over time with different background conditions and potentially highlight factors that are associated with the observed temporal changes.\"\u00a0\n\nResearchers excluded CA calls related to trauma, overdose or suicide, and the protocols were the same for the full 30-month study period, \"allowing for a consistent comparison between the call counts during the baseline, pandemic, and vaccination periods.\"\n\nThe vaccine rollout period for 16-39 year-olds, January-May 2021, coincided with the third COVID wave in Israel. It showed a \"statistically significant increase of over 25%\" for both kinds of calls compared to the same period in 2020.\u00a0\n\nFor CA specifically, there was \"no statistically significant difference in the respective call volume\" between full-year 2019 and 2020. For ACS, the \"significant relevant increase\" in that full-year period (15.8%) was outpaced by the January-May 2021 increase (26%).\n\nThe researchers said the January 2021 increase \"seems to track closely the administration of 2nd dose vaccines,\" while a second observed increase starting April 18 \"seems to track an increase of single-dose vaccination to individuals who recovered from COVID-19 infections.\" (The Israel Ministry of Health approved the latter for ages 16 and up in early March 2021.)\n\nFemales unexpectedly had a higher jump in calls: 31% for CA and 41% for ACS, compared to increases for males of 25% CA and 21% ACS.
