Someone said it was much worse compared to the  Netherlands and I thought \"hating on the trains is a favourite past time  in every country I've lived in, including the Netherlands. Surely it  can't be actually that much worse here.\" So because I am a nerd, I went  out to find the data.\n\nSpoiler alert:&gt;! they were right. It is indeed bad!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Late and unreliable**\n\nBritish  trains are not punctual at all. Local transport is late 1.5 times as  much as the average EU country: 12% of the time vs 8% average EU; long  distance trains are even worse: almost a quarter of them are late! (23%  vs 17% EU average and only 7% in the Netherlands).\n\nBut  the worst part is the number of cancelled trains: 3.5%. That might not  sound bad, but the EU average is about 1.5% -- though the Netherlands  scores around 2% so not great either.\n\nThis data is all from the excel produced by the venerable EU [here](https://transport.ec.europa.eu/transport-modes/rail/market/rail-market-monitoring-rmms_en),  specifically tabs 113-118. It is a bit older, but subsequent reports  didn't include this granular data or were years where train travel was... abnormal for the same reason everything has been.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The big cities do OK but not the countryside or inter-city travel**\n\nMy  original argument was that it is unfair to compare the UK to the  Netherlands given the difference in size and population density. I went  looking for data which might account for these differences and found [this report](https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/information/publications/working-papers/2020/rail-transport-performance-in-europe),  again by the EU. Essentially, it measures rail performance by  calculating how many people can be reached within a 1.5h journey. They  then divide this by the number of people living within a 120 km radius  to account for population density.\n\nBy  this metric, the UK is actually the 4th best, well ahead of the  Netherlands (unsurprisingly, the Swiss win). Great news. The UK rail  does OK given its geography. I'm so smart. Except...\n\nThey  go into more detail and find that basically, the UK does well for  cities and suburbs, but is pretty consistently average or below average  for villages and rural areas. London is well-connected, as are Glasgow  and Edinburgh. Birmingham, Manchester/Liverpool do OK too and  Leeds/Bradford to a lesser degree. But that's about it. To be fair,  France does pretty piss-poor (not in Paris? ha, shouldn't have been a  pleb then) but there are certainly places where access is divided more  equally.\n\nTo make matters worse,  the report also looks at the connection between cities that are close to  each other. To quote: \"Only ten city pairs have a rail connection that  is slower than 60 km/h (Table 2). They are all located in the UK.\" The  table on city pairs without any rail connection at all isn't much  better: 5/15 city pairs are in the UK.\n\nSo  in essence, if you live in a big city, chances are the train does OK.  As long as you don't want to go to the countryside or often even the  next city over. Which to me seems like it's rather the point of trains.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**And you pay a lot for this crap**\n\nSo  far, so bad. By now I really have to get back to work, but I couldn't  resist looking into the costs too. The excel I linked earlier also has  info on this (tabs 31-35). In essence, it depends on what metric you  use, but the UK is consistently in the top 4 most expensive countries  per kilometre travelled, behind Luxemburg and sometimes France or  Norway. That's basically the same conclusion as [this BBC article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49346642). Long live privatisation and the supposed ability of markets to bring costs down I guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo  long story short, I've been converted and will now shit on UK trains  like a good Britton. Except with data. Please don't deport me."}
