For this purpose, the `<inspire_common:Conformity>` element shall be added within an `<inspire_vs:ExtendedCapabilities>` (see Implementation Requirement 23 in [INSPIRE NS - View Service TG](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/documents/technical-guidance-implementation-inspire-view-services-1))  or an `<inspire_dls:ExtendedCapabilities>` (see TG Requirement 53 in  [INSPIRE NS - Download Service TG](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/documents/technical-guidance-implementation-inspire-download-services)) element. \r\nAs the common opinion in the sub-group is that the extended capabilities should be removed, we need to find an element in the service metadata to use instead of the `<inspire_common:Conformity>` element, keeping the conformance to metadata Regulation.\r\n\r\n### [Proposal from IT](#13) (me)\r\nHaving as reference the Regulation 1089/2010 (against which it is mandatory to declare the conformance based on Metadata TG),  the proposal is adding a specific keyword encoded with the values coming from the [code list \"Degree of conformity\"](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/DegreeOfConformity) published in the INSPIRE metadata code list register.\r\nWith respect to other specifications (e.g. Regulation 976/2009), each service provider is free to add an extended capabilities section (that is kept as optional) including the `<inspire_common:Conformity>` element.\r\nHere the examples about this proposal:\r\n\r\n- For WMS, add a `wms:Keyword` element with a value coming from the code list mentioned above and the attribute `vocabulary` pointing to the code list URI within the `wms:KeyworList` group\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n...\r\n<wms:KeywordList>\r\n   <wms:Keyword vocabulary=”https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/DegreeOfConformity”>conformant</wms:Keyword>\r\n...\r\n</wms:KeywordList>\r\n```\r\n\r\n- For WFS, add a specific group `ows:Keywords` with a `ows:Keyword` element with a value coming from the code list mentioned above and a `ows:Type` element including the code list label and the attribute `codeSpace` pointing to the code list URI:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n...\r\n<ows:Keywords>\r\n   <ows:Keyword>conformant</ows:Keyword>\r\n   <ows:Type codeSpace=\"http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/DegreeOfConformity\">Degree of conformity</ows:Type>\r\n</ows:Keywords>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n- For Atom, add a `atom:category` element including the `term` attribute with a value coming from the code list mentioned above and the `scheme` attribute pointing to the code list URI:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n...\r\n<atom:category term=\"conformant\" scheme=\"https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/DegreeOfConformity\"/>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Proposals from FR (@MarieLambois)\r\n\r\n- adding a specific keyword encoded with the values coming from the [Spatial data service type code list](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/SpatialDataServiceType) to declare the conformity (see the specific [comment in the issue 12](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/gp-data-service-linking-simplification/issues/12#issuecomment-881270930).\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n...\r\n   <wms:Keyword vocabulary=\"http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/SpatialDataServiceType\">view</wms:Keyword>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n- Alternatively, adding a specific keyword to cite the Regulation applied for the conformity declaration (see the specific [comment in the issue 13](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/gp-data-service-linking-simplification/issues/13#issuecomment-941073992)).\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n...\r\n<wms:KeywordList>\r\n   <wms:Keyword vocabulary=”https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/LevelOfConformity”>COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 976/2009</wms:Keyword>\r\n...\r\n</wms:KeywordList>\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INSPIRE-MIF/gp-data-service-linking-simplification/issues/39/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/INSPIRE-MIF/gp-data-service-linking-simplification/issues/39/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rolfkleef/research/issues/16","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rolfkleef/research","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rolfkleef/research/issues/16/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rolfkleef/research/issues/16/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rolfkleef/research/issues/16/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rolfkleef/research/issues/16","id":1081968656,"node_id":"I_kwDOFX16Tc5AfYgQ","number":16,"title":"Open
