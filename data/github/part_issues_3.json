Datasets and Distribution come with their own set of mandatory elements. A portal normally also offers a page for every Datasets it contains. Those blank-node-datasets would pollute the catalog in my opinion.\r\n\r\nSince `dcat:endpointDescription` has the cardinality of `*`, we could simply advise the following:\r\n```\r\n_:dataservice a dcat:DataService ;\r\n  dct:title \"A Title\" ;\r\n  dct:license <http://dcat-ap.de/def/licenses/dl-zero-de/2.0> ;\r\n  dcat:servesDataset _:dataset-123 ;\r\n  dcat:endpointURL <https://example.org/api/;\r\n  dcat:endpointDescription <https://example.org/api/wfs?service=WFS> ;\r\n  dcat:endpointDescription [ \r\n    dct:format <http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/file-type/JSON> ;\r\n    dct:format <http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/file-type/XML> ;\r\n  ]\r\n.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, we could formalize it by creating a class like `dcatap:MicroEndpointDescription`.\r\n\r\nI think something like this might be a good idea for DCAT-AP. We have the narrower use case of data portals and there a simple and EU-wide solution would be useful. This blank-node (or the new class) could have other recommended properties, based on the needs of the portal user who searches for a DataService.\r\n\r\nI would also question the need of Distributions in the context of a data portal, as in: \r\nA Dataset should only have downloadable Distributions and DataServices.\r\nThe DataService is linked to the Dataset via servesDataset. A Distribution that soley links to the DataService does not add a lot of useful information.\r\n\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14979304/148521633-3e9cfb45-f116-41ef-8ec9-999999c1de83.png)\r\n\r\n(We are currently evaluating how DataServices can be modeled the best way and have not yet come to a conclusion...)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SEMICeu/DCAT-AP/issues/217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SEMICeu/DCAT-AP/issues/217/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slovensko-digital/ekosystem/issues/16","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slovensko-digital/ekosystem","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slovensko-digital/ekosystem/issues/16/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slovensko-digital/ekosystem/issues/16/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slovensko-digital/ekosystem/issues/16/events","html_url":"https://github.com/slovensko-digital/ekosystem/issues/16","id":189483223,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxODk0ODMyMjM=","number":16,"title":"Data z EU vestnika","user":{"login":"jsuchal","id":26342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsuchal","html_url":"https://github.com/jsuchal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsuchal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsuchal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsuchal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsuchal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsuchal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsuchal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsuchal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsuchal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsuchal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":404025552,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MDQwMjU1NTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slovensko-digital/ekosystem/labels/help%20wanted","name":"help wanted","color":"128A0C","default":true,"description":null},{"id":482272523,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0ODIyNzI1MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slovensko-digital/ekosystem/labels/small","name":"small","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2016-11-15T19:27:17Z","updated_at":"2018-08-13T07:00:20Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Niektore obstarka su rychlejsie v EU vestniku ako v tom nasom.

more classes and properties of DCAT-AP (optional classes) can be added to data catalogues and that data receivers (i.e. opendata.swiss) will have to pass them through (for instance to data.europa.eu)

Proposal for an updated definition for the concept “dataset”_\r\n\r\n# Background and problem statement\r\n\r\nThis is a joint proposal for an updated definition for the concept “dataset”, made by the Danish Agency for Digitisation [1] (member of W3C) and the Danish Agency for Data Supply and Efficiency (member of OGC and, through Danish Standards, member of ISO/TC 211).\r\n\r\nThe Danish government wants to describe data consistently across authorities, processes and IT systems [3]. In order to achieve this, definitions of the same concepts must be aligned where possible, not only within domains but also across domains.\r\n\r\n“Dataset” is used in many different domains and is a highly relevant concept these days, e.g. in the context of the European INSPIRE Directive [4] and the PSI Directive [5]. The Agency for Digitisation and the Agency for Data Supply and Efficiency therefore request W3C, OGC and ISO/TC 211 to come to an agreement regarding using the same definition and notes for “dataset” and submit a first draft for discussion.\r\n\r\n# Proposal for updated definition and related notes\r\n\r\n**dataset** \r\ncollection of data that is regarded as a unit\r\n\r\n- Note 1 to entry: Typically, a dataset is collected for a certain purpose.\r\n- Note 2 to entry: Typically, a dataset is described using metadata elements including an identifier and a title.\r\n- Note 3 to entry: Typically, a dataset is available for use in one or more representations. \r\n- Note 4 to entry: Typically, a dataset is published or curated by a single agent.\r\n- Note 5 to entry: Typically, the data in a dataset are related through a common topic.\r\n- Note 6 to entry: Typically, the data in a dataset have the same syntactic structure.\r\n- Note 7 to entry: Typically, the data in a dataset are managed using the same governance processes.\r\n- Note 8 to entry: Typically, the data in a dataset have a shared data provenance.\r\n- Note 9 to entry: The arrangement of data in one or more datasets is a decision, based on formal requirements or informal considerations.\r\n\r\n| Data catalog specific notes | Geographic information specific notes |\r\n| ---- | ---- |\r\n| Note 10 to entry: In the context of DCAT, a dataset is published or curated by a single agent.                          | Note 10 to entry: In the context of geographic information, a dataset can be a smaller grouping of data which, though limited by some constraint such as spatial extent or feature type, is located physically within a larger dataset. Theoretically, a dataset can be as small as a single feature or feature attribute contained within a larger dataset. |\r\n| Note 11 to entry: In the context of DCAT, a dataset is available for access or download in one or more representations. | Note 11 to entry: In the context of geographic information, a hardcopy map or chart can be considered a dataset.|\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Examples of datasets that are not “typical” according to the notes for “dataset”: \r\nIn order to highlight the need for all the notes to the definition of “dataset”, hereby a list of examples that are not “typical” according to those notes. The examples are not intended to be included in any standard, but are meant as a basis for the discussion. The examples follow the same numbering as the notes above.\r\n\r\nExample 1: Dataset that is too large or complex to analyze with the current technologies, but that might be useful when technology evolves.\r\nExample 2: A temporary dataset, such as the result of an SQL query.\r\nExample 3: A planned dataset, that is not yet available or collected.\r\nExample 4: OpenStreetMap data; in general: data collected via crowdsourcing.\r\nExample 5: A use case where data from many different domains (different subjects) is combined to solve a particular problem or need (one purpose).\r\nExample 6: GeoPackage containing vector, raster and styling; EU-dataset where some of the data are INSPIRE-harmonized and some are not.\r\nExample 7: Data collected at the local level in a country, and then aggregated to one dataset containing data for the whole country; data sent in to EEA by the EU member states, and which is then aggregated to one dataset.\r\nExample 8: Dataset containing data having different licences; dataset created by taking subsets from different other datasets.\r\n\r\n# References\r\n- [1] https://en.digst.dk/\r\n- [2] https://eng.sdfe.dk/\r\n- [3] THE GOVERNMENT / LOCAL GOVERNMENT DENMARK / DANISH REGIONS.

the German XBildung project [we](https://xbildung.de/web/) have the following proposal \r\nregarding the encoding of countries and other codes  (ISCED2013, EQF/NQF, ISCED 2013) in future ELMO versions  \r\nfor the sake of enhanced interoperability and reuse of multilingual ressources in Europe.\r\n\r\n**Context:**\r\nELMO refers to \"an Europass\" ISO Country Code list under the namespace http://europass.cedefop.europa.eu/Europass/V2.0\r\n\r\nOther emerging standards like the SDG-Datamodels or the current Europass Learning Model refer to Publications Office Country code list instead:  https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/dataset/-/resource?uri=http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/country\r\n\r\n**Example**:\r\nGermany instead of \r\n  `  <country>DE</country>`\r\ncould also be referred to as  \r\n    `<country>http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/country/DEU</country>`\r\n\r\nPoland instead of \"PL\" can be referred to \r\n`    <country>PL</country>`\r\ncould also be referred to as  \r\n  `  <country>http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/country/POL</country>`\r\n\r\nIn doing so the data exchange interoperability specifications SDG and Europass benefit from the following features:\r\n\r\n**reasonings for changing** to a new country code lists (still the same ISO 3166)\r\n1. active governance and redistribution by EU Publications Office in different formats, _see https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/dataset/-/resource?uri=http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/country for more information_\r\n2. existing namespace, the namespace \"http://europass.cedefop.europa.eu/Europass/V2.0\" became outdated to our understanding long time ago - when governance for Europass shifted from CEDEFOP to DG EMPL - when Publications Office started publishing Europass vocabularies here https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/europass \r\n3. can express European realities like Kosovo or former countries like http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/country/DDR or other countries not being able to be expressed via the current ELMO \"Europass ISO List\" \r\n4. using URIs instead of values can bring all ELMO users the translation of country names in all EU languages![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99474274/169386844-d42a0dea-4ffb-4dc2-9a24-1a6b266f468a.png) \r\nsee here for http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/country/POL and http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/country/DEU\r\n\r\n5. the country code list from PO is used in other education specifications to express educational credentials like \r\n\r\n- the future SDG data models \r\nsee admin unit level 1 from ISA Core Vocabularies Location\r\nhttps://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/blob/master/evidences/tertiary_education_diploma_evidence/data_model/tertiary_education_diploma_evidence_tables.md\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99474274/169387015-7b543c35-5265-40db-8170-6fa099b9f11b.png)\r\n\r\n- Europass see https://github.com/european-commission-empl/European-Learning-Model/blob/master/Europass_Learning_Model.md#location (\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99474274/169387910-66d326dd-f8b1-4be0-bf89-a225eb457bbf.png)\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the proposal is here \r\nto enhance european interoperability of ELMO \r\nby expressing countries (and perhaps citizenships) \r\nusing the Publications Office country code list in form of using the concept URIs. \r\nIt bears the same two-digit ISO information but comes with the features described above.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease not that the same benefits are true for the following Publications Office code lists currently used in ELMO as \"strings\" instead of URIs:\r\na) EQF/DQF  http://data.europa.eu/snb/eqf/25831c2\r\nb) languages https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/dataset/-/resource?uri=http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/language \r\nc) ISCED-F 2013

Include as much detail as you can in your answer._\r\n\r\n## Project details\r\n\r\nShare a brief history of your project and organization.\r\n```\r\nThe SUT was founded in 1966, providing both undergraduate and graduate programs across 14 main departments in science and engineering and also has established several research centers. These centers, while maintaining their own separate identities, co-exist within the university system.  This arrangement gives individual researchers the opportunity and flexibility to conduct research while establishing a working relationship between the university and industry.\r\nIn SUT, there are about 480 faculty members, 550 staff and +10000 students.\r\nSTU has many international activities and is known globally around the world for its International Affairs (Iraq, Pakistan, Russia, Japan, Bolivian, Netherlands, India, ...).\r\nSUT is decided to store its public scientific data in a decentralized manner in web3 storage platforms to increase accessibility and reliability of information that users can achieve data globally.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is the primary source of funding for this project?\r\n```\r\nThe SUT.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat other projects/ecosystem stakeholders is this project associated with?\r\n```\r\nNone.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Use-case details\r\n\r\nDescribe the data being stored onto Filecoin\r\n```\r\nAll files are students, researchers and faculties public data of SUT including theses & dissertations, lectures, books, articles and papers, periodicals, open data, open projects,... .\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere was the data in this dataset sourced from?\r\n```\r\nThey are all public data of SUT's students, researchers and faculties.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan you share a sample of the data? A link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this. \r\n```\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1y8XkeBTLYYRLZ5vfUoiS0gVi7xo4h2G9/view?usp=sharing\r\n```\r\n        \r\nConfirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the Network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data).\r\n```\r\nYes. All data is open to the public.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected retrieval frequency for this data?\r\n```\r\nIt depends on users' needs.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin?\r\n```\r\nWe tend to keep them as long as possible, as a permanent mirror.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## DataCap allocation plan\r\n\r\nIn which geographies (countries, regions) do you plan on making storage deals?\r\n```\r\nFew countries (about 6-10) from all regions including Asia/Middle East.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow will you be distributing your data to storage providers? Is there an offline data transfer process?\r\n```\r\nThe data can be transferred both offline and online. It depends on SPs' location and online data transfer rate.

A quick explanation would be:\r\n>     - `/vague term/`\r\n>     - `//extra vague term//`\r\n>     - `[precise term]`\r\n>     - `[[extra precise term]]`\r\n\r\nThe submitter suggests some explicit way to, without need to directly use language dependent head terms, be viable to conciliate data from different files. One common way would be to create short numeric identifiers and separators of such numbers.\r\n\r\nSome of the numbers are related to the CPV itself, but some presented here use a syntax that works to explain relationships between the terms on each dataset implementation.\r\n\r\n### Use case 1: interoperability for conciliate translations of core vocabularies\r\nThe most basic use case would be link translations which already are not part of the 24 European Languages. When preparing translations/terminology, is necessary some concept-like identifier:\r\n\r\n- a `<termEntry id=\"[conceptum-id]\">` on a [TermBase eXchange (TBX)](https://www.tbxinfo.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/tbx_oscar.pdf) \r\n- a `<tu tuid=\"[conceptum-id]\" >` on a [Translation Memory eXchange (TMX)](https://www.gala-global.org/tmx-14b)\r\n- a `<unit id=\"[conceptum-id]\">` on [XML Localization Interchange File Format (XLIFF)](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/xliff-core/v2.1/os/xliff-core-v2.1-os.html#unit)\r\n\r\nBy looking at documentation of SEMICeu, it could be possible to make such identifier with such as `Person:alternative name` (`SEMICeu::Person:alternative name`) or `Core-Person-Vocabulary:Person:alternative name` (`SEMICeu::Core-Person-Vocabulary:Person:alternative name`).\r\n\r\n#### Why this writing system non neutral approach already is not as perfect for multilingual terminology\r\nUsing a concept identifier such as `Person:alternative name` (24 characters) or `SEMICeu::Core-Person-Vocabulary:Person:alternative name` (56 characters) is not a problem to use with technology. We used something like this on [HXL-CPLP-Vocab_Auxilium-Humanitarium-API/schemam-un-htcds.tm.hxl](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ih3ouvx_n8W5ntNcYBqoyZ2NRMdaA0LRg5F9mGriZm4/edit#gid=1292720422) since the reference work was already using this.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of who manually created them (without any tooling) it is easier to manage than define numbers. But numbers:\r\n- would have the advantage of allowing terminology creators to change the head terms without breaking things if the underlying meaning is still the same.\r\n- are both more compact and writing system neutral (think about lexicographers from other regions of the world)\r\n\r\nHowever, Core-Person-Vocabulary (CPV) currently does not have any explicit strategy of concept identifiers, so not even `Person:alternative name` instead of some planned `12.34` exist. But for translations itself, not using neutral codes is less an issue for lexicographers, and more for internal management. Requires more discipline from creators.\r\n\r\n### Use case 2: very compact meaning together with human labels\r\n\r\nAnother use case is to have some way to express the concept together with labels for end user documentation, such as UML diagrams.\r\n\r\n**eng-Latn**:\r\n\r\n- SEMICeu\r\n    - `[12] Person`\r\n        - (...)\r\n        - `[12.34] alternative name`\r\n        - (...)\r\n    - `[14] Legal Entity`\r\n        - (...)\r\n        - `[12.56] alternative name`\r\n        - (...)\r\n\r\nNamespaced compact numbers, while at first could be manually put on diagrams, after already having stored all terminology language variants (which are more than average translations) could eventually be reused to create diagrams or other documentations replacing placeholders with they're actual variant.\r\n\r\n**prs-Arab**\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\r\n\r\n- `//جامعه قابلیت همکاری معنایی//`\r\n    - `[12] //شخص//`\r\n        - (...)\r\n        - `[12.34] //نام جایگزین//`\r\n        - (...)\r\n    - `[14] //نهاد قانونی//`\r\n        - (...)\r\n        - `[14.56] //نام جایگزین//`\r\n        - (...)\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n> Note: the terms in Farsi and Arabic script are not reviewed.\r\n\r\n> Trivia: Arabic numbers are read from left to right, even on right-to-left scripts. In this example, they're at the start of the term (don't make sense to say left or at right when speaking about a term in languages, but start and end)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure which file formats are used by SEMICeu to create the UMLs, but the JSON-LDs could be templated. Unlike XML, there is no JSON strategy to localize, so the only way would be pre-processing entire files based on single arrival with all terminology language variants.\r\n\r\nSome difference in this use case from others is that the end result is **to be interpreted visually by readers**. The codes may still be relevant to simplify how to generate the final format based on template files. Also note that despite using Unicode Digits (the term used on Unicode for numeric range workout explicit formatting) each template generation could use any valid numeric system, which means [١٢.٣٥](Eastern Arabic numerals) is same as [12.34] (Western Arabic numerals); see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_numeral_systems. **But** different writing systems, the numeric system on Arabic Numbers are quite popular, so the likelihood of someone knowing (or learning) [12.34] is plausible. But even direct symbol by symbol from \"alphabets\" is not viable.\r\n\r\n### Use case 3: machine parsable coding systems together with labels\r\n\r\nDifferent from case 2, the use case here is generation of output files which do not support complex meanings but we still bruteforce them as short codes. The examples will use CSV headings and even more restrictive places, such as URLs slugs, as examples, but all other file formats are easier to work with.\r\n\r\nIn the following CSV example, the decision was done using a similar strategy of visual UML using `[]` to enclose codes. Either prefixed or suffixed codes could be used (but not in the middle of a string). The example, which uses the exact English term (but real use cases people always will customize it, so most labels already are not reliable) uses suffix strategy (end of term):\r\n\r\nCSV, **eng-Latn**:\r\n\r\n| alternative name [12.34] | alternative name [14.56] |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| Road Runner | ACME |\r\n\r\nCSV, **prs-Arab**:\r\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\r\n\r\n| نام جایگزین [12.34] | نام جایگزین [14.56] |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| کوکوی دونده | شرکت برتر |\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nSometimes, even if CSV allows spaces and a full range of delimiters, people may want to create headers with more limited range in addition to the letters/symbols for each language. This is common for URL slugs (or as HTMl anchors).\r\n\r\nURL-slug, **eng-Latn**:\r\n- `alternative-name--12-34` (double delimiter)\r\n- `altrrnative-nane_12-34` (different delimiter, uses reference term with misspelling)\r\n- `lawyer_12-34` (different delimiter, totally different language term)\r\n\r\nURL-slug, **mul-Zyyy**:\r\n- `aliud-nomen--12-34` (double delimiter, any language)\r\n- `备用名称--12-34` (double delimiter, any language)\r\n- `மாற்று பெயர்--12-34` (double delimiter, any language)\r\n\r\nMore examples could be given, but the argument here is that as long as it would be possible to have a generic function extract the code from an string (which can have no code, or have codes for unknown terms) it is worth to allow such flexibility. Also most of the time these codes will be used (if not with definition) with one or more terms. There is some room for human error (like write `11-34` instead of `12-34`) but it would be better to improve generic, more universal tools that allow users \"check what the dataset means\" than try to add human letters, since even short mnemonic codes can also have human errors.\r\n\r\n### Use case 4: know which type of thing (like type of person) an implementation uses (unsolved)\r\nVery often real world datasets which save data in tabular format (and not rare, on other formats that allow complex schemas) actually are not talking about the same thing, even if labels may be near similar. This means the encoding could actually reveal this type of relation.\r\n\r\nLet me use as example the Human Trafficking Case Data Standard (HTCDS), https://github.com/UNMigration/HTCDS, as toy example.\r\n\r\n| Case Owner | First Name | Nationality | Type of Exploitation |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| (person 2, manages the case) | (person 1, survivor given name) | (person 1, nationality) | (person 1, not encoded field yet)\r\n\r\nOn this case, most of the fields are for a survivor (of human trafficking), but there are references for another person who manage the case. The HXL Standard (see https://hxlstandard.org/) tend to recommend add hashtags only to most important fields, so if for simpler cases such as the HTCDS, this would means simply not add codes to Case Owner, which could already be ok for minimal interoperability. Using CPV and some other vocabularies, already would be possible to know what is about a person, but if HTCDS itself be encoded + terminologically translated for very specialized fields such as the _Type of Exploitation_ (which is very, very specific), **then the way codes for something like Core-Person-Vocabulary are done, could also allow not just reuse for other standards, but also compact ways for they create terminological translations**. However, I still think the code numbers should be short, because this type of work of scaling up translations and publishing for general use with an open license is uncommon.\r\n\r\n**But going back to Core-Person-Vocabulary, the main problem is the following**: the main problem is the following: still an open issue to know \"types of person\" in a namespace such as the examp `12.*` would be talking about, with special focus for some limited number of types of persons that often appear on data exchange related to human rights violations. This would generate translations beyond the \"Person 1 alternative name\" to \"Lawyer 1 alternative name\", \"Judge 1 alternative name\", (...). This type of generalization could also apply for Core-Business-Vocabulary to specify a Hospital or police department. But in practice, most \"grammar\" tends to be reusable from Core-Person-Vocabulary, but maybe some strategy to be more specific could allow both better translations and also very optimized conversion from data from different places. And automated processing tends to be quite important, since this could be used to detect outliers when the human rights defenders could be targeted if they try to explain to outsiders.\r\n\r\n### Use case 4: know which type of thing a implementation uses by groups\r\n\r\nWhile the previous Use case is more complex (not only from deciding the pattern of coding) but may need planning on calling up translations, there is something which could be done in a generic way: an additional separator, for example `~`, which would allow to specify some sort of explicit grouping. Without such a separator, some type of default group could be assumed, such as `~0`.\r\n\r\nThe separation of alternative names from person and business already is part of the Core Vocabulary semantics. But a single person can have more than one alternative name or the dataset can be calling about two different persons. Another case is when there are more persons and more business, and a business is related to all persons (maybe this would be implicitly with the default `~0`, like a broadcast address https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_address equivalent on IP addresses) but if numeric indices are explicitly used, this could make the relationship explicy.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n\r\n| `Attacker name [12.34~1]` | `Survivor name [12.34~2]` | `Company name [14.56]` |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n|  Wile E. Coyote | Road Runner | ACME |\r\n\r\nMeans that have two different persons, but the business is related to all persons: `Company name [14.56]` is the same as `Company name [14.56~0]`\r\n\r\nBut\r\n\r\n| `Attacker name [12.34~1]` | `Survivor name [12.34~2]` | `Company name [14.56~2]` |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n|  Wile E. Coyote | Road Runner | ACME |\r\n\r\nIn this case, the business is related to only person 2. \r\n\r\nThe numeric approach is quite compact (and may be generic enough to have it's semantics used for other types of Vocabularies). But note that when something more complex as this is necessary, very likely either the codes would have some help to allow users to implement them or they would be handcrafted (like assign codes for a data standard such as the HTCDS).\r\n\r\n**What about the language translations for complex cases?** Well, depending on the syntax, the numeric encoding could be more complex (to a point of require a full grammar specialized for each case, like Grammar Framework https://www.grammaticalframework.org/) but if the focus is more around the idea of make interoperable by machines, instead of \"translate\" to a natural language, it could create new headings that actually are friendly to be processed in something else (like HXL hashags https://hxlstandard.org/standard/1-1final/dictionary/). I will not over-complicate here, but the point is that it could be possible to convert CSV to XML.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use case 5: nested levels (including not used on final Core Vocabularies)\r\nWhile the UML diagrams put all data from persons on the same level, at least one numeric code, one potential interesting feature would be to group all terms related to the name of the person under a namespace such as `[12.10] //Any type of person name//`. This approach would mean instead of `[12.34] alternative name`, the code would be `[12.10.34] alternative name`.\r\n\r\nOne downside of this approach is that _ideally_ also a shadow term not on CPV would need to be added on the translations tables. Without this, if some code is not known on the multilingual terminology, such as `[12.10.99] nicknames in the workplace` would fallback directly to the concept `[12] Person` instead of `[12.10] //Any type of person name//`.\r\n\r\nIn general, the idea of having some type of nested nevels is to allow some type of granularity. So if someone is using a more specialized field, then the best baseline would be the closest concept. So if \"nicknames in the workplace\" is a type of `[12.10.34] alternative name`, the best place for person create a nested concept would be `[12.10.34.99] nicknames in the workplace` since on worst case the parser would assume it is a specialized type of `[12.10.34] alternative name` and the generic translation on eng-Latn could be `[12.10.34.99] alternative name 99`.\r\n\r\n### Use case 6: strategy for private namespace when using numeric codes\r\nThis is the last use case (and is relevant since codes could be short, but not _too short_). My suggestion is to avoid using numbers lower than 10 even if generic parsers could work if they find translations with such codes as exact matches on the file with all terminologies.\r\n\r\nOne downside of the advantage of Use case 5 (the one about allowing any subdivision at any level) is that it reduces changes of known user error. Actually, even if the user could see the translation with a hint that this was not a script match, since mostly such conversions would be automated, it would be better to allow scripts that convert between formats to return an error and break the automation pipeline.\r\n\r\nIn other words: if someone try to generate translations (or convert between formats) if code patterns are found, but there is not even the concept of that term (which is different of have the concept, but not exact translation for that language, for this users tend to like allow some auxiliar language as fallback) even if a script could know how to generate a upper translation, unless user ask to tolerate, it will raise error.\r\n\r\nThen, what about if users want to publish datasets without immediate intent of releasing the terminological translations to not break others data pipelines? My suggestion to _mitigate the mitigation_ of the use case 5 is to allow the use of private codes. My current suggestions on this would be number 5 (between 0 and 9) to start a private prefix. So I instead of `[12.10.34.99] nickname from workplace` an `[12.10.34.5.99] nickname from workplace` wouldn't not raise errors. But to allow other potential special uses (not just private use) then the entire range from 0 to 9 could have special semantics for tools trying to read all full concept codes and deciding which one is the ideal one **if they already are not found as part of some concept code**. For example, if a user edited some XML or spreadsheet with all concepts and manually added the exact match, the processor would not need to allow any advanced checking.\r\n\r\nSo, in practice, the use of any level of codes lower than 10 could still work, but when something is not found and there is a number lower than 10, the fallback strategy can be specialized.\r\n\r\n### example of result of all use cases\r\n\r\n> Note: \r\n> - codes such as `[12.10] //Any type of person name//` are not needed to show on UMLs, since they are not intended to be used directly, but are relevant for linguistic purposes in which the average end user implementation will not care. The purpose is to have an implicit taxonomy even when terminology is flattened.\r\n> - The `[12.10.34.5.99] nickname from workplace` **is a private term** where the user does not intend to publish OR it is a proposed term for SEMICeu not approved and used for testing. Tooling should try search by `[12.10.34.5.99]`, then `[12.10.34.99]`, then the know `[12.10.34] alternative name`, potentially with label \"`alternative name 5.99`\"@eng-Latn or \"`نام مستعار از محل کار 5.99`\"@prs-Arab\r\n\r\n**eng-Latn**:\r\n\r\n- SEMICeu\r\n    - `[12] Person`\r\n        - (...)\r\n        - `[12.10] //Any type of person name//`\r\n        - `[12.10.34] alternative name`\r\n        - `[12.10.34.5.99] nickname from workplace`\r\n        - (...)\r\n    - `[14] Legal Entity`\r\n        - (...)\r\n        - `[12.56] alternative name`\r\n        - (...)\r\n\r\n**prs-Arab**\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\r\n\r\n- `//جامعه قابلیت همکاری معنایی//`\r\n    - `[12] //شخص//`\r\n        - (...)\r\n        - `[12.10] //هر نوع نام شخصی//`\r\n        - `[12.10.34] //نام جایگزین//`\r\n        - `[12.10.34.5.99] //نام مستعار از محل کار//`\r\n        - (...)\r\n    - `[14] //نهاد قانونی//`\r\n        - (...)\r\n        - `[14.56] //نام جایگزین//`\r\n        - (...)\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nPlease note that, with the exception of the suggestion of restricting use of numbers lower than 10 and the suggestion of 5 for private codes, **all numbers used here are examples**. This means that if CPV was the first Core Vocabulary (on the knowledge of who distributes the numbers at the moment), it would have preference over the lowest number assigned by SEMICeu if no one is sure. Also, note that numbers don't need to be sequential. In this example `[12.34] alternative name` was moved to `[12.10.34] alternative name` and the submitter decided to keep the old local number, but it could be renamed for something different, with a lower number. THe point is that it is the responsibility of SEMICeu to decide who is responsible by the `[12] Person`, and then it is the responsibility of `[12] Person` to explain the **grammar** of every namespace under it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## IV - proposed solution, if any\r\n\r\n> Note: **This proposal is not a release blocker**. Even if the idea of adding some sort of concept code is accepted, this is more likely to happen after CPV 2.00 already is released.\r\n\r\nThat's it: it's about implementing concept codes with our own internal implicit taxonomy.\r\n\r\nNote that for use cases such as emergency response, quite often would exist intermediate layers without term language and the initial round would unlikely to be perfect. So best use cases would be to tolerate deprecated codes or any other feature to allow delivery of the first round as fast as possible (think hours, not weeks).\r\n\r\n### Tasks the submitter is willing to help\r\n\r\n#### Proof of concepts to validate the implicit taxonomy on such codes (code)\r\n\r\nThe submitter, as part of previous work on @HXL-CPLP, and as a user of @HXLStandard from a majority non-English speaker community, already has experience on the good and bad parts of how to deal with multilingual content. The major part of the already public domain code used on https://hapi.etica.ai is being more generalized to a point where even a non-XML format such as average spreadsheets can be used as a source to extract what each concept means for any language available.\r\n\r\nSo, extracting and converting back and forth language versions already is not a problem for us (even if most open source and commercial tools can't cope well with such tasks when more than 2 languages are involved; that's why we had to resort to implement tools to solve our own translation management issues to make not just Portuguese versions viable).\r\n\r\n**But** the task we're talking about here is some generic proof of concept of either such numeric codes or at least some common patterns users would do (like analyzing each header) and then return the most appropriate translation.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that such algorithms be simpler (but without limiting levels) and work as some sort of grammar, while the vocabulary is fully on multilingual files. The reason for them being simpler is that if they are too complicated (like Unicode CLDR is) it would be hard to port the functions for different programming languages.\r\n\r\nI think proof of concept both on Python (for more heavy work) and JavaScript (potentially to be referenced later to explain for users online what something means) would be a good baseline.\r\n\r\nAlso, something simpler makes it easier to create user documentation. This means less documentation to translate.\r\n\r\n#### Compile Core Vocabularies on some multilingual format which SEMICeu would likely prefer\r\nWe from @HXL-CPLP use HXL (more strictly http://hxltm.etica.ai) as working format mostly because of allow directed use from collaborative online spreadsheets and allow users exchange CSV or edit with Excel, but for projects like CPV, I think a XML like TBX is the closest to a strict standard which would be able to be edited by hand while we could still export to any other file.\r\n\r\nThe point here is that a more realistic proof of concept (and actually a step before allowing direct reuse with other vocabularies) would require that all vocabularies from SEMICeu already have a single source of truth.\r\n\r\nIf SEMICeu would break per project, then maybe I could try some way to either by providing shell scripts or by explaining how to use GitHub Actions, the final work is compiled. Since things are already automated, the point here is to try to at maximum reduce human error, something actually not uncommon. It may not be as relevant on SEMICeu but is on smaller initiatives.\r\n\r\n#### Localized Schemas/Documentation/Scripts/etc beyond English\r\nXMLs/RDFs standards often allow be multilingual (even if this is not widely used in practice) but most schemas and documentations formats don't\r\n\r\nThis means for example JSON-LDs, or formats viable for direct usage such as Table Schema (frictionless data) and OpenAPI are strictly monolingual. You simply cannot add language variants because the standard doesn't permit it. So use of English on computing is still limited by tooling even when volunteers speak multiple languages.\r\n\r\n**However**, we from HXL-CPLP cope with this by making multilingual files directly usable to extract target language (with optional auxiliary language in case of missing translations, something common when drafting new things) and concert templates for the final result. The template engine used is the popular Liquid (Used by Shopify, GitHub Pages, etc) with some extensions. This means that to scale up to all new translations, after having a multilingual source of truth (or divided ones, but they are merged on the previous step) like TBX, each template can be converted to target languages.\r\n\r\nWe can help you with that.\r\n\r\nThe additional complexity compared to just doing it in one language manually is higher. The breaking point may be around 3 languages. This also becomes an advantage when having several files (even in the same language) where the values are the same and a human can copy paste wrong or forget something.\r\n\r\n### Non-technical request from submitter\r\n\r\n#### Explicitly dedicate the numeric codes to public domain (or equivalent) and ask others to do the same\r\n\r\nFirst, some context. Most tools done by an average open source volunteer (like embed ISO codes on software) do it freely. But more academic, governamental and (this is my focus) humanitarian area will not be republished. Licensing is taken so seriously that no exception like \"people are dying because information managers (IM) are using old code tables\" would allow lawyers to take risks publishing compiled tables on a place such as HDX (https://data.humdata.org/). But even a humanitarian IM which would have the skills to know what to do, will have no time to download things. Everything is urgent all the time.\r\n\r\nSo, my non-technical request is that if such numeric code be implemented, please consider put **explicitly** on Public Domain. And then if others link their vocabularies, ask then that the numeric coding taxonomy be also public domain equivalent. Please note I'm NOT even asking the terms or contextual information (like TBX from IATE do https://iate.europa.eu/legal-notice) but the codes.\r\n\r\nThis approach both allow others users reuse the numbers from other regions without need to be approved by lawyers of their organization and, in (case of more specialized vocabularies for human rights use on European context, which can themselves become targets) even when original source is removed from online access, at least the coding system republished by others cannot be blocked due to licenses issues. The explanation of what they mean is complicated. When strange things happen, it is already better for outsiders to create non licensed equivalents.\r\n\r\nAnother point on the codings being open in such a way is to avoid breaking software (like interlink between vocabularies) and also that providers (SEMICeu is at European level, but think local level) can republish a minimal interoperable set. Please note that one major use case are users (not just human right defenders) who cannot count with help from IT personnel and not hard; their use cases are so specialized that cannot be predicted by outsiders. I'm not saying that more centralized approaches are not useful, but _in the field_ if we manage to make the main logic portable even as Excel macros or GSheet scripts, this is relevant. But without some way for them to download already compiled translations on a single file, they would be too busy.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SEMICeu/Core-Person-Vocabulary/issues/39/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SEMICeu/Core-Person-Vocabulary/issues/39/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1.0}]}
