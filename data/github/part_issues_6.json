to` appears twice as property. Having the definition _An established standard to which the described resource conforms._ \r\n\r\nHowever it is not clear to what the conforms to actually refers. To the metadata that is in the catalog, or the information that is described by the metadata.\r\n\r\nthe usage notes state\r\n- [cataloged resource](https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/dcat/#Property:resource_conforms_to):  This property SHOULD be used to indicate the model, schema, ontology, view or profile that the cataloged resource content conforms to.\r\n- [catalog record](https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/dcat/#Property:record_conforms_to): \r\n   This property SHOULD be used to indicate the model, schema, ontology, view or profile that the catalog record metadata conforms to. \r\n- [distribution](https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/dcat/#Property:record_conforms_to): This property SHOULD be used to indicate the model, schema, ontology, view or profile that this representation of a dataset conforms to. This is (generally) a complementary concern to the media-type or format. \r\n\r\nWhat does that mean for a Catalog, Dataset, DataService? Are that the rules imposed on the DCAT structure used? E.g. the rules from DCAT-AP (SE)?\r\nThen I come to the distribution case which is not about the additional constraints on the metadata for the distribution, but about the actual content. E.g. I use the INSPIRE-address model. \r\nThat is not the same interpretation for conforms-to. \r\n\r\nSuppose I have a harvesting data-portal like the European Data Portal, then it would be nice to know which metadata profile the descriptions conform to. Each entity conforms-to a EU memberstate profile. But know I cannot know that for distributions, because that describes the ontology used by the actual data.

codes that are marked as being in that codelist, but don't appear when the tree is built from the top-down (which is how we currently fetch the data to build the tree UI).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIn case it's helpful, these are the steps I did to get a hold of the relevant data and convince myself of what's going on (I did these from a repl with the namespaces from `ook.search.elastic.codes` loaded):\r\n- search for the code with id `http://data.europa.eu/nuts/code/UKL`\r\n```clj\r\n(esd/search (esu/get-connection \"http://localhost:9200\")\r\n

`http://data.europa.eu/nuts/scheme/2016` is included in the schemes for that code (which is the \"NUTS - Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics classification (2016)\") one with the problem here)\r\n- Note it has no  `topConceptOf`, so follow the broaders up:\r\n```clj\r\n(esd/search (esu/get-connection \"http://localhost:9200\")\r\n                                      \"code\"

\"status\" - e.g., draft, stable, deprecated, withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe EU Publications Office maintains some reference code lists - the two that may be most relevant here are:\r\n- [Dataset status](https://publications.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/at-concept-scheme/-/resource/authority/dataset-status/?target=Browse)\r\n- [Concept status](https://publications.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/at-concept-scheme/-/resource/authority/concept-status/?target=Browse)\r\n\r\nE.g., the dataset status code list above includes the following statuses (alphabetically ordered):\r\n\r\nCode | Label | Definition\r\n-- | -- | -- \r\nCOMPLETED | completed | This dataset is considered to be complete, it holds all information that is intended.\r\nDEPRECATED | deprecated | It is recommended that the contents of this dataset be no longer used.\r\nDEVELOP | under development | This dataset is currently being assembled. It may be in an incomplete or faulty state.\r\nDISCONT | discontinued | This dataset is no longer produced or updated.\r\nWITHDRAWN | withdrawn | This dataset is no longer meant to be published.\r\n\r\nThe concept status code list includes additional statuses.\r\n\r\nThis information is clearly useful for administrative purposes, but relevant as well for users.\r\n\r\nE.g., in the JRC Data Catalogue, these statuses determine where a dataset can be published (e.g., a dataset in draft status is not supposed to be published in production). On the other hand, deprecated, discontinued, or withdrawn records are not removed from the catalogue (because of the persistence policy we have in place), but they are \"marked\" as such, so that users are aware they shouldn't be used or are not longer available.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/w3c/dxwg/issues/1238/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/w3c/dxwg/issues/1238/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OP-TED/ePO/issues/286","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OP-TED/ePO","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OP-TED/ePO/issues/286/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OP-TED/ePO/issues/286/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OP-TED/ePO/issues/286/events","html_url":"https://github.com/OP-TED/ePO/issues/286","id":935746747,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5MzU3NDY3NDc=","number":286,"title":"where

In most cases these labels are fine but the Cyrillic and Greek ones appear to have encoding problems - e.g. BG has \"БЪЛГАРИЯ\" and \"????????\" (`hd` inspection of the download shows these are literally `U+003F` - question marks).\r\n\r\nRequesting with a `'Accept: application/rdf+xml;charset=UTF-8'` header makes no difference as it's a statically-hosted file.\r\n\r\nThe RDF files for individual NUTS codes - e.g. [BG](http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/nuts/code/BG) - don't have this problem (so presumably they _do_ have language tags somewhere upstream). We could ask for them to fix it.\r\n\r\nWe could also crawl all of those pages.\r\n\r\nAlternatively we could try to filter the bad labels out as part of the step which [de-dupes multiple labels](https://github.com/GSS-Cogs/GDP-vocabs/blob/master/filters/deDuplicateSkosPrefLabels.sparql). \r\n\r\nAbsent a language tag, we need some way to distinguish the good vs bad label.\r\n\r\nThe order isn't consistent in the file sadly (even if this were to be maintained deterministically by the `sparql` cli tool).\r\n\r\nInstead we might be able to do something like `FILTER NOT (regex(str(?label), \"\\\\?\"))`.\r\n\r\nIndeed we might to have the dedupe step filter instead of concatenating the labels (e.g. taking the first of those without encoding problems).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GSS-Cogs/GDP-vocabs/issues/8/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/GSS-Cogs/GDP-vocabs/issues/8/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SEMICeu/e-legislation-pilot/issues/2","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SEMICeu/e-legislation-pilot","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SEMICeu/e-legislation-pilot/issues/2/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SEMICeu/e-legislation-pilot/issues/2/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SEMICeu/e-legislation-pilot/issues/2/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SEMICeu/e-legislation-pilot/issues/2","id":257688115,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNTc2ODgxMTU=","number":2,"title":"cited_by
