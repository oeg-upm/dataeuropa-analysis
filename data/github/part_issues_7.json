Diploma Supplement is jointly developed by the Council of Europe, European Commission and UNESCO and an updated version was adopted by the Lisbon Recognition Convention Committee in 2007.\r\n\r\n[http://www.ehea.info/media.ehea.info/file/2018_Paris/72/5/MEN_conf-EHEA_AG4_02_950725.pdf](http://www.ehea.info/media.ehea.info/file/2018_Paris/72/5/MEN_conf-EHEA_AG4_02_950725.pdf)\r\nshows a template which has at least the following information **in addition** or more precise to the current proposal of the SDG evidence \"University Diploma supplement\"\r\n\r\n1. **language of instruction / examination**\r\n2. **main fields of studies**\r\n3. level of qualification\r\n4. official duration of programme in credits (ECTS) and/or years \r\n5. **access requirements**\r\n6. **mode of study**\r\n7. **Programme learning outcomes**\r\n8. **grade distribution table**\r\n9. **linking the transcript of record to the diploma supplement**\r\n\r\nMore in detail copying the explanatory notes: and _suggesting controlled vocabularies in italic_\r\n\r\n1:Language(s) of instruction/examination:\r\nIndicate the language(s) by which the qualification was officially delivered and examined.\r\n_My recommendation is to use the language code list from PO\r\nhttp://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/language_ \r\n\r\n2: main fields of studies\r\nShow only the major field(s) of study (disciplines) that define the main subject\r\narea(s) for the qualification e.g. Politics and History, Human Resource Management, Business\r\nAdministration, Molecular Biolog y etc\r\n\r\n_My recommendation is to use the ISCED 2013F code list in addition to a text field for the sake of an interoperable approach as mentioned earlier https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/issues/95#issuecomment-691908592_\r\n \r\n_ISCED 2013 codes are availabe in machine readable formats from Eurostat codelist server RAMON and can be expressed as ISA² metadata rdf vocabularies also :_\r\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=LST_CLS_DLD&StrNom=CL_ISCEDF13&StrLanguageCode=EN&StrLayoutCode=HIERARCHIC\r\n_Once transfered to RDF they could be hosted together with other \"SDG-Codelists\" using a persistent URI here \r\nhttps://data.europa.eu/URI.html_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Level of qualification\r\nGive the precise level of the qualification and its place in the specific national\r\neducational structure of awards, and/or in the National Qualifications Framework,\r\nif available (cross-referenced to the information in point 8). Reference should also be\r\nmade to the corresponding level in the two main overarching Qualifications Frameworks:\r\nQF-EHEA and/or EQF, e.g., Second cycle QF-EHEA/Level 7 EQF.\r\n\r\n_My recommandation is instead of using only text to use the ISCED 2011 Level, also available on RAMON\r\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=LST_NOM_DTL_LINEAR&IntCurrentPage=3&StrNom=CL_ISCED11&StrLanguageCode=EN_\r\n_and suggested also by Belgium https://github.com/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/issues/119_\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Official duration of programme in credits and/or years:\r\nIndicate the total student workload required and/or the official duration of the\r\nprogramme in years of full-time study. The student workload should be described in terms\r\nof credits and the credit system used should be indicated. EHEA countries are expected\r\nto make reference to the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS), e.g. 2 years /120 ECTS credits.\r\n\r\n5: Access requirement(s)\r\n List the qualification(s) or periods of study required for access to the programme\r\ndescribed by this Diploma Supplement (cross-referenced to the information in point 8),\r\ne.g. Matura (for access to a first degree programme) or Bachelor Degree (for access to a\r\nsecond degree programme). This is particularly important when intermediate studies\r\nare a prerequisite for the named qualification. \r\n\r\n_My recommendation is to check whether ISCED-Level 2011 can also be used here_\r\n\r\n6:  Mode of study: \r\nThe mode of study refers to how the programme was undertaken e.g. full-time,\r\npart-time, intermittent/sandwich, e-learning, distance, etc. \r\n\r\n_My recommendation is to use the Europass vocabulary learning-opportunity\r\nhttp://data.europa.eu/snb/learning-opportunity/25831c2_ \r\n_and to cross check whether other vocabularies from Europass might be useful https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/europasstables_\r\n\r\n7:  Programme learning outcomes\r\n Indicate the learning outcomes associated with the qualification. Learning outcomes\r\nare statements of what the graduate knows, understands and is able to do after completing\r\nhis/her studies and receiving the qualification (knowledge, skills, competencies). Learning\r\noutcomes should be expressed in the present tense, e.g.: “The graduate can analyse\r\nconsumer behaviour trends and apply them in a given consumer market”. This information\r\nis increasingly becoming the key basis on which qualifications are assessed and/or\r\nrecognized. \r\n\r\n8: Grading system and, if available, grade distribution table:\r\n Provide information on the grading system and pass marks relating to the qualification,\r\ne.g.: marks are out of a possible 100% and the minimum pass mark is 40%. Tremendous\r\nvariations in grading practices exist within and between different national higher education\r\ninstitutions and countries. In order to provide information on the use of grades in a\r\nspecific context, a grade distribution table relating to the qualification in question should\r\nbe included. If more than one grading system is used, e.g.: in the case of joint degrees,\r\ninformation should be provided on all systems used for the qualification in question. If this\r\nsection is too long, it can be included in the transcript of records\r\n\r\n9. Linking the transcript of record to the DS\r\n_my recommendation is to link the transcript of record (what here is currently called \"results from the previous academic year\"to the diploma supplement_ \r\nThe explanatory notes state:\r\n(if this information is available in an official transcript this should be used here) \r\n\r\n\r\nThe DS template looks like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70315945/95157378-1f36ae00-0799-11eb-9c19-d5801cb66053.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70315945/95157407-39708c00-0799-11eb-94ec-2b102db404ca.png)\r\n\r\nVarious real life Diploma, Diploma Supplements and Trancripts of records (in the SDG data model and [the Deloitte Study ](https://sdg.mindigital.gr/uploads/Deloitte_final_report.pdf) called \"results from the previous academic year\") from Higher Education Institutions (including Universities) are published by students in the internet.\r\nSee here a full example of a German and English from the Technical University of Munich\r\nhttps://me.benediktschmidt.at/data/master_zeugnis.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/issues/120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SEMICeu/SDG-sandbox/issues/120/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2258","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/schemaorg/schemaorg","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2258/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2258/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2258/events","html_url":"https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2258","id":448180959,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NDgxODA5NTk=","number":2258,"title":"Request for inverse property of 'fundedItem'","user":{"login":"ashepherd","id":2117576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTc1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2117576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashepherd","html_url":"https://github.com/ashepherd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashepherd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashepherd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashepherd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashepherd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashepherd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashepherd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashepherd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashepherd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashepherd/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2204591588,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjA0NTkxNTg4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/schemaorg/schemaorg/labels/no-issue-activity","name":"no-issue-activity","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Discuss has gone quiet.

the navy data, tools are currently (in CASS) atomized as a framework of competencies. @Lomilar did this (correct me if I'm wrong) due to the implied competence with tools when they are applied (which was done in that data by the ceasn:prerequisiteAlignment property) to Maintenance Tasks and Training Tasks (e.g. \"this task requires you to be able to use a wrench\").\r\n\r\nExamining the data for tools, the ceasn:CompetencyText field just has the name of a tool and no other contextualizing information (e.g. \"wrench\", \"hammer\", \"screwdriver\", etc.).\r\n\r\nIt is therefore my contention that:\r\n- The navy data's tools competency framework should be a concept scheme instead\r\n- The assertion that a task requires a given tool is separate from the assertion that the performer of the task needs to be competent with that tool (even if these two assertions go together in what appears to be all cases)\r\n  - \"Completing this task requires a screwdriver\" (the data itself) implies \"And you have to know how to use a screwdriver\", but this is not sufficient reason to call \"screwdriver\" itself a competency\r\n  - Conceivably there could be a tools framework containing the K/S/As for tools (particularly if a given tool has more than one intended function or usage, such as different attachments for a power tool, or even \"put nail in\" vs \"get nail out\", both of which involve different usages a hammer). This framework would reference the tools concept scheme, and this framework's competencies could/would be referenced by Maintenance Tasks and Training Tasks\r\n    - e.g. \"Performing this task requires \"Competency: K/S/A with a wrench\", which in turn references \"Concept: Wrench\"\r\n    - Perhaps the task references both the concept and the competency? Or is the competency implicit in the reference to the concept (see below)?\r\n\r\nThat same list of tools could just be a list of concepts in another context:\r\n- A listing of how many of each kind of tool are aboard a ship\r\n- A listing of which tools should go in a toolbox\r\n- A listing of which sailor has which tool in-hand during performance of a task\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\nIn CTDL, there are some parallels where concepts imply a competency (knowledge/skill/ability) when used in certain ways, but those are not inherent attributes of the concepts themselves:\r\n- [AssessmentMethod](https://credreg.net/ctdl/terms/AssessmentMethod)\r\n  - Example: An assessment with an assessment method of \"Performance\" implies the K/S/A \"And you have to be able to perform the thing being assessed\"\r\n- [Delivery](https://credreg.net/ctdl/terms/Delivery)\r\n  - Example: a learning opportunity that is only offered \"In Person\" implies the Ability \"And you have to be able to physically get to the classroom\"\r\n- [AudienceLevel](https://credreg.net/ctdl/terms/AudienceLevel)\r\n  - Example: a credential targeted to \"Advanced Level\" implies the K/S/A \"And you must have obtained advanced level K/S/As to pursue this credential\"\r\n\r\nIt is my position that the navy data contains a list of tools as a concept scheme.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there may be something worth exploring in the idea of \"implied\" competencies (where a reference to a concept, by virtue of simply referencing that concept, implies some competency directly related to that concept).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CredentialEngine/Schema-Development/issues/631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CredentialEngine/Schema-Development/issues/631/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MichaMican/DAGISCoronaAnalysis/issues/1","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MichaMican/DAGISCoronaAnalysis","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MichaMican/DAGISCoronaAnalysis/issues/1/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MichaMican/DAGISCoronaAnalysis/issues/1/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MichaMican/DAGISCoronaAnalysis/issues/1/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MichaMican/DAGISCoronaAnalysis/issues/1","id":603888652,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MDM4ODg2NTI=","number":1,"title":"Automate

definition of \"dataset\" is the one from DCAT. However, ISO/TC 211 uses [another definition](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:19115:-2:ed-2:v1:en:term:3.6), and ISO/TC 211 maintains a [glossary of terms](https://committee.iso.org/sites/tc211/home/re.html), with the purpose to encourage consistency in the use and interpretation of geospatial terms.\r\n\r\nGiven the fact that OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core is supposed to become an ISO/TC 211 standard, this is an issue.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the following proposal, also submitted via W3C (see https://github.com/w3c/dxwg/issues/1195) and ISO/TC 211.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Background and problem statement\r\n\r\nThis is a joint proposal for an updated definition for the concept “dataset”, made by the Danish Agency for Digitisation [1] (member of W3C) and the Danish Agency for Data Supply and Efficiency [2] (member of OGC and member of ISO/TC 211).\r\n\r\nThe Danish government wants to describe data consistently across authorities, processes and IT systems [3]. In order to achieve this, definitions of the same concepts must be aligned where possible, not only within domains but also across domains.\r\n\r\n“Dataset” is used in many different domains and is a highly relevant concept these days, e.g. in the context of the European INSPIRE Directive [4] and the PSI Directive [5]. The Agency for Digitisation and the Agency for Data Supply and Efficiency therefore request W3C, OGC and ISO/TC 211 to come to an agreement regarding using the same definition and notes for “dataset” and submit a first draft for discussion.\r\n\r\n# Proposal for updated definition and related notes\r\n\r\n**dataset**\r\ncollection of data that is regarded as a unit\r\n\r\nNote 1 to entry: Typically, a dataset is collected for a certain purpose.\r\nNote 2 to entry: Typically, a dataset is described using metadata elements including an identifier and a title.\r\nNote 3 to entry: Typically, a dataset is available for use in one or more representations.\r\nNote 4 to entry: Typically, a dataset is published or curated by a single agent.\r\nNote 5 to entry: Typically, the data in a dataset are related through a common topic.\r\nNote 6 to entry: Typically, the data in a dataset have the same syntactic structure.\r\nNote 7 to entry: Typically, the data in a dataset are managed using the same governance processes.\r\nNote 8 to entry: Typically, the data in a dataset have a shared data provenance.\r\nNote 9 to entry: The arrangement of data in one or more datasets is a decision, based on formal requirements or informal considerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n| Data catalog specific notes | Geographic information specific notes |\r\n| ---- | ---- |\r\n| Note 10 to entry: In the context of DCAT, a dataset is published or curated by a single agent.                          | Note 10 to entry: In the context of geographic information, a dataset can be a smaller grouping of data which, though limited by some constraint such as spatial extent or feature type, is located physically within a larger dataset. Theoretically, a dataset can be as small as a single feature or feature attribute contained within a larger dataset. |\r\n| Note 11 to entry: In the context of DCAT, a dataset is available for access or download in one or more representations. | Note 11 to entry: In the context of geographic information, a hardcopy map or chart can be considered a dataset.|\r\n\r\nIn order to highlight the need for all the notes to the definition of “dataset”, hereby a list of examples that are **not** “typical” according to those notes. The examples are not intended to be included in any standard, but are meant as a basis for the discussion. The examples follow the same numbering as the notes above.\r\n\r\nExample 1: Dataset that is too large or complex to analyze with the current technologies, but that might be useful when technology evolves.\r\nExample 2: A temporary dataset, such as the result of an SQL query.\r\nExample 3: A planned dataset, that is not yet available or collected.\r\nExample 4: OpenStreetMap data; in general: data collected via crowdsourcing.\r\nExample 5: A use case where data from many different domains (different subjects) is combined to solve a particular problem or need (one purpose).\r\nExample 6: GeoPackage containing vector, raster and styling; EU-dataset where some of the data are INSPIRE-harmonized and some are not.\r\nExample 7: Data collected at the local level in a country, and then aggregated to one dataset containing data for the whole country; data sent in to EEA by the EU member states, and which is then aggregated to one dataset.\r\nExample 8: Dataset containing data having different licences; dataset created by taking subsets from different other datasets.\r\n\r\n\r\n# References\r\n\r\n[1] https://en.digst.dk/\r\n[2] https://eng.sdfe.dk/\r\n[3] THE GOVERNMENT / LOCAL GOVERNMENT DENMARK / DANISH REGIONS. _The digitally coherent public sector_ [online].

di richiesta**: richiesta di informazione\r\n\r\n## Riassunto\r\n\r\nMi riferisco al file doc-covid19-ita-andamento-nazionale.csv e nonostante la documentazione (Readme) ho forti dubbi sulla corretta interpretazione dei dati: fatemi sapere se potete occuparvene voi o se si debba invece indirizzare quanto sotto direttamente alla protezione civile.\r\n\r\nLa colonna totale_casi risulta uguale alla somma di totale_attualmente_positivi + dimessi_guariti + deceduti, il che suggerisce che il primo di questi addendi si riferisca ai soli casi aperti (persone ancora ammalate).\r\n\r\nIn tal caso però quando un caso si chiude (comunque ciò avvenga: per guarigione o per decesso) la colonna totale_attualmente_positivi deve decrescere, in quanto in passato tale caso è quasi certamente transitato tra quelli aperti (ospedalizzati o in isolamento domiciliare): quindi suppongo che la colonna nuovi_attualmente_positivi (che è l'incremento esatto di totale_attualmente_positivi) rappresenti in realtà il saldo netto tra i nuovi contagi scoperti nel giorno e il numero di casi che vengono chiusi nel medesimo giorno.\r\n\r\nQuindi:\r\n\r\n- vorrei **sapere se la mia supposizione** sull'interpretazione di nuovi_attualmente_positivi **è corretta**\r\n\r\n- in caso affermativo **suggerisco di migliorare il template** esplicitando il numero di contagi del giorno: oggi infatti è molto probabile che l'attuale campo nuovi_attualmente_positivi venga interpretato banalmente ma erroneamente come il numero di contagi identificati nel giorno. \r\n\r\nQuest'ultimo dato, importante per monitorare la progressione del contagio, sarebbe invece desumibile dal delta giornaliero della colonna totale_casi (che del resto è quanto viene già oggi comunicato dall'Italia a livello Europeo: https://data.europa.eu/euodp/it/data/dataset/covid-19-coronavirus-data)\r\n\r\nUn'osservazione aggiuntiva, che va oltre l'attuale template: è un peccato che per ogni nuovo contagio identificato non si tenti di riclassificarne la data sulla base della data di comparsa dei primi sintomi (idealmente si vorrebbe quella di contagio, ma ovviamente è spesso molto difficile se non impossibile), sempre per riuscire a tracciare meglio la rapidità di progressione dell'epidemia: con il metodo attuale il trend di progressione rischia di essere influenzato anche da altri fattori (quali la disponibilità quotidiana di tamponi o cambiamenti nella strategia di test), in casi estremi si rischia perfino di usare la data del decesso\r\n\r\n\r\n## Interesse pubblico\r\n\r\nPresentare in questo dataset il numero di nuovi contagi  in modo corretto (o senza rischio di malintesi) aiuterebbe i mezzi di informazione e forse anche le autorità a tracciare la progressione dell'epidemia in modo migliore e a valutare meglio l'efficacia delle misure di contenimento
