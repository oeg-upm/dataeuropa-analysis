have read the document d02.01_specification_of_the_process_and_methodology_v0.12_1. Thank you very much for making the overview available. Please find some comments in the Word document uploaded at the end of this post. I apologize for not opening a separate GitHub issue for each comment, but it would take too long. Also, I think most of the comments do not perhaps need to have their own thread for discussion. (If you think otherwise, I would kindly ask the administrators to open the necessary issues based on the comments.) \r\n\r\nJust to highlight the most important comment: I'm new to this area so perhaps I misunderstood a basic feature of the methodology, but I'm not really sure how _relationships_ and _properties_ are being used. They are named as if they should be general (which is, I think, correct), e.g. _hasVAT_, _publishes_. However, the definitions (and domains and ranges) limit the use to only one specific situation. For example, _hasVAT_ is defined as \"This property specifies an amount of Value Added Tax charged on an invoice.\", which excludes it's use for values of notices, lots, contracts, etc.; _publishes_ is defined as \"This property links a contracting authority to a call for tender that it makes available\", which excludes publications by contracting entities, review bodies, other types of buyers, etc. and other types of documents, such as corrections, contract awards, modifications, etc.  I would expect the definitions of relationships and properties to be context independent, so that they can be used to describe relationships between many different classes? \r\n\r\nOther comments include comments on terminology (esp. consistency in its use), examples, other existing projects, etc. \r\n\r\n[d02.01_specification_of_the_process_and_methodology_v0.12_1_jh.docx](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/files/952041/d02.01_specification_of_the_process_and_methodology_v0.12_1_jh.docx)\r\n\r\n \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OP-TED/ePO/issues/14/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OP-TED/ePO/issues/14/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/semantalytics/xsparql/issues/20","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/semantalytics/xsparql","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/semantalytics/xsparql/issues/20/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/semantalytics/xsparql/issues/20/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/semantalytics/xsparql/issues/20/events","html_url":"https://github.com/semantalytics/xsparql/issues/20","id":221215236,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMjEyMTUyMzY=","number":20,"title":"XSParql parsing fails if SPARQL query contains inner curly braces in UNION or OPTIONAL","user":{"login":"tfrancart","id":2728945,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3Mjg5NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2728945?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfrancart","html_url":"https://github.com/tfrancart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfrancart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfrancart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfrancart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfrancart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfrancart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfrancart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfrancart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfrancart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tfrancart/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-04-12T10:14:04Z","updated_at":"2017-04-12T10:21:44Z","closed_at":"2017-04-12T10:21:44Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"```\r\ndeclare namespace eli = \"http://data.europa.eu/eli/ontology#\";\r\n<ELI xmlns:eli=\"http://data.europa.eu/eli/ontology#\">\r\n{\r\n  for $LegalResource from <eli-data.ttl>\r\n  where { \r\n  \t$LegalResource a eli:LegalResource .\r\n  \tOPTIONAL { $LegalResource eli:in_force ?in_force . }\r\n  }\r\n  return \r\n  <LegalResource eli:URI=\"{$LegalResource}\" />\r\n}\r\n</ELI>\r\n```\r\n\r\nProduces\r\n\r\n```\r\nline 4:2 mismatched input 'for' expecting LCURLY\r\nline 6:3 mismatched input '$LegalResource' expecting LCURLY\r\nline 7:14 mismatched input '$LegalResource' expecting LCURLY\r\nline 9:2 mismatched input 'return' expecting ENDELM\r\nline 11:16 no viable alternative at input ' '\r\nParse error: java.lang.Exception: Errors for Parser.

think referring to the Eurostat open data and open data portal is bit misleading.

The package, however, do get its data from the Eurostat main database and the reference on README is for the Eurostat main page. The open portal do get its data from the same source, but to refer to the Open data portal, we should use their API.
